=520  \\$a'Dionysus in 69' is the first performance of The Performance Group that emerged in 1968 from a workshop led by Richard Schechner in November 1967 shortly after he arrived from Tulane University to teach at NYU. 'D69' was the first environmental theater production shown at the Performing Garage, the long-time home of TPG and later, the Wooster Group that emerged in 1980 from TPG. A free-wheeling adaptation and distortion of Euripides' 'The Bacchae', 'D69' is notable for the combination of a number of 'firsts' for the New York theater, including audience participation, man-to-man kissing, and full-frontal nudity of both women and men. The Performing Garage was filled with platforms and towers, the floor covered with carpets. There were no seats which meant that performers and spectators shared the space, sitting on the floor or perched on scaffolds. 'D69' was created during a long period of workshops and rehearsals. 
=520  \\$aThe production - like all of Schechner's work that followed - was never finished. Before each performance, Schechner gave extensive notes and made many revisions. Over the 14-month run, the roles were rotated among the cast, including a woman playing the god Dionysus (Joan MacIntosh). The Performance Group used their performances as a means of confronting the psychic, physical, social, and political work of the performer and the spectator. The film was made by De Palma and his colleagues from footage shot during two in June and July, 1968. The film uses two screen images shown simultaneously to give some feel of the totally inclusive environmental theater technique pioneered by Schechner. Richard Schechner is a theater director, performance theorist and university professor known for being one of the founders of the academic discipline of Performance Studies at Tisch School of the Arts, New York University.   
=520  \\$aSchechner combines his work in anthropology with innovative approaches to performance of all kinds including ritual, drama, environmental theater, political rallies, dance, music, etc. in order to consider how performance can be understood not just as an object of study, but also as an active intellectual-artistic practice. He is the editor of 'TDR: The Journal of Performance Studies.' His books include 'Environmental Theater,' 'The Future of Ritual,' 'Performance Theory,' 'Between Theater and Anthropology' and 'Performance Studies: An Introduction.' As of 2007, his books have been translated into 14 languages.

=520  \\$aLos Vendidos is a television adaptation of an acto first staged by El Teatro Campesino in 1967. The piece is set in Honest Sancho's Used Mexican Lot and Curio Shop, where various models of Chicano automatons (robots) are displayed for sale by Honest Sancho. Into his shop comes Miss Jimenez who represents the governor's office (at the time, Ronald Reagan's) and is in search of a Mexican type for the administration. Sancho escorts her around his shop and demonstrates various floor models (farm worker, Mexican revolutionary, pachuco, lowrider), activating them by snapping his fingers and giving vocal commands. None of these are acceptable to her. She wants a Mexican, yes, but it is more important that he be an American. She is about to leave when Honest Sancho urges her to view his newest model: a fresh, clean Mexican-American in a business suit and glasses, whom she instantly loves and purchases on the spot for {dollar}15,000 (a great deal of money in 1972). She drives off with him to the governor's banquet. Once she is gone, Sancho falls silent, and all the store models come to life. We learn that Sancho is the real automaton and all the others are Chicanos and Chicanas running a scam on fools who believe in robots. The acto is bracketed by opening and closing scenes on a pyramid, where many of the characters from ETC's actos are arranged, frozen in action. In the very center is the Aztec Calendar, whose painted face is that of Luis Valdez, founder and director of El Teatro Campesino.

=500  \\$aEarlier version of La Carpa de los Rasquachis.
=520  \\$aThis Carpa de los Rasquachis was preceded by another carpa (tent show) written by Luis Valdez, called La Carpa Cantiflesca (1972). Since 1965, Valdez had described El Teatro Campesino as a cross between Brecht and Cantinflas. La Carpa Cantinflesca was his attempt to pay homage to the great comic and Mexican movie star Mario Moreno, a.k.a. Cantinflas, who had begun his career performing in Mexican tent shows. Thus in La Carpa Cantinflesca Valdez created a family of Cantinflas types: Cantinfin, Cantinflon, Cantinflucha; all the characters, including the women, wore Cantinflas costumes. The piece told the story of the family in three parts: the parents (Mexicans), the sons (Mexican-Americans), and the daughter (La Chicana). When the idea proved to be too esoteric, Valdez eliminated the Cantinflas references but kept the three generational elements, and renamed the show Carpa de los Rasquachis. This early version of La Carpa still retains the three-act family structure, utilizing corridos (Mexican ballads) to provide the narrative line. In time, it became apparent that the three-generation structure and the epic nature of their collective tale were too much for a single play. So, after 1974, Valdez conflated all three stories into a single focus on one main corrido, the story of the patriarch, Jesus Pelado Raquachi, peripherally telling the story of the family. In this early version of the Carpa de los Rasquachis, titled La Familia Rascuache, it is clear that Valdez and the Teatro were still wrestling with creative elements regarding the acting style, musical arrangement, and narrative continuity of its single Corrido, which ultimately gave shape to the final, precise 1975 version called La Gran Carpa de Los Rasquachis.

=520  \\$aThis film documents and to some degree rearranges the scenes of TPG's production. In 'The Tooth of Crime' Shepard draws on popular/mythic figures and motifs of the American imaginary such as the cowboy, the rock star, the girl friend, the disc-jockey, and the drifter-outsider. The language of the play is rhythmic with a richness of alliteration and syncopation that The Performance Group actors further embroidered through their verbophysical techniques to produce harmonies, tensions, and emotional and physical states. The drama embodies the contradictions inherent in a star system that creates 'personalities' only to discard them when they are no longer commercially productive. Using their own version of rock music, TPG explores in a complex physical environment a world of gangsters and urban cowboys. 
=520  \\$aThe performance presents a myriad of comic book characters that underscore the deceptions and failures of the 'American Dream.' The subtleties of the characterization, environmental theater mise-en-scene, music, and movement make this production unique. Because the environment makes viewing all of the action from one place impossible, spectators flow with the action from one part of the theater to another. The performance of Spalding Gray as Hoss is perhaps his best work in the 'regular' theater. Richard Schechner is a theater director, performance theorist and university professor known for being one of the founders of the academic discipline of Performance Studies at Tisch School of the Arts, New York University.

=520  \\$aThe Colectivo de Acciones de Arte (CADA) is a Chilean activist group of artists who used performance to challenge the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile. One of the most important contributors to the Escena Avanzada, CADA incorporated strategies of theatricality and performance as an essential element to all its art actions, while questioning the practices and institutions of all politics and conceiving art as a necessary social practice that eradicated the traditional distance between the artist and the spectator. Committed to the foundation of an open and spontaneous practice of spectatorship, their interventions in everyday life intended to interrupt and alter the normalized routines of the daily urban life of the citizen, by means of a semiotic subversion that decontextualized and semantically restructured urban behaviors, locations and signs.
=520  \\$aOn October 17, 1979, eight milk trucks left the Soprole milk factory to drive through the city of Santiago according to a previously planned route, which ended at the National Museum of Fine Arts, where the trucks stood for hours forming a long line. The route symbolically connects a milk producing factory with a conservative 'art factory', the museum. This connection is further performed by closing the entrance to the Museum by covering the façade with a large white cloth. This civil action sought to expose political violence, cultural censorship, and human misery in a country threatened and under surveillance by Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship. The Museum was under the control of the dictatorship so the milk trucks worked as a critical reference to military technology and Pinochets regime. The white cloth sought to evoke and resist political repression; it indicated that art was not inside the museum but outside, dispersed in the city, clandestine.
=520  \\$aShown in this video clip is the productive 'backstage' of the action: the workers at the milk plant packaging the milk and the milk trucks driving through the city. Then we see the long line of parked trucks in front of the Museum of Fine Arts. The artists at its front door spread a large white cloth in order to cover the entrance. They haul down the Chilean flag.

=520  \\$aThe Colectivo de Acciones de Arte (CADA) is a Chilean activist group of artists (artists Lotty Rosenfeld and Juan Castillo, sociologist Fernando Balcells, poet Raúl Zurita and novelist Diamela Eltit) who used performance to challenge the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile. One of the most important contributors to the ‘Escena Avanzada’, CADA incorporated strategies of theatricality and performance as an essential element to all its ‘art actions’, while questioning the practices and institutions of all politics and conceiving art as a necessary social practice that eradicated the traditional distance between the artist and the spectator. Committed to the foundation of an open and spontaneous practice of spectatorship, their ‘interventions in everyday life’ intended to interrupt and alter the normalized routines of the daily urban life of the citizen, by means of a semiotic subversion that decontextualized and semantically restructured urban behaviors, locations and signs.
=520  \\$aOn the 10th year of Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship in Chile, CADA proposed the slogan 'NO +' (NO more). This was meant as an open text to be completed by the citizens, according to their specific social demands (No more __). CADA invited Chilean artists from different fields to spread this message on walls all over Santiago. Wall tagging was the first form of NO+, but the slogan was soon used by different collectives all over the country as a massive public symbol of political resistance and non-conformity.
=520  \\$aShown in this video clip is photographic documentation of wall tags with the slogan ‘NO+’ all over Santiago.

=520  \\$aThe Colectivo de Acciones de Arte (CADA) is a Chilean activist group of artists who used performance to challenge the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile. One of the most important contributors to the 'Escena Avanzada', CADA incorporated strategies of theatricality and performance as an essential element to all its 'art actions', while questioning the practices and institutions of all politics and conceiving art as a necessary social practice that eradicated the traditional distance between the artist and the spectator. Committed to the foundation of an open and spontaneous practice of spectatorship, their 'interventions in everyday life' intended to interrupt and alter the normalized routines of the daily urban life of the citizen, by means of a semiotic subversion that decontextualized and semantically restructured urban behaviors, locations and signs.
=520  \\$a'Para no morir de hambre en el arte' is a multi-faceted 'art action' performed in 1979 addressing the problem of hunger and poverty, endowing milk with the symbolic power to represent this unrepresentable political issue. The performance consisted of several actions: passing out milk to people in Santiago's slums; parading milk trucks through the city's streets; calling attention to the performance with full-page ads in periodicals; enacting the group's message in front of the local United Nations building; altering the façade of a museum to draw it into the theme of the performance; broadcasting, through loudspeakers located outside the CEPAL building, a critical speech; and filling an acrylic box with 100 milk bags, an issue of the periodical 'HOY' and an audiotape with the broadcasted critical speech in an art gallery.
=520  \\$aShown in this video clip is camera material of the action inside the gallery. Artists and audience gather around the acrylic box; a close-up allows reading an inscription: 'Para permanecer hasta que nuestro pueblo acceda a sus consumos básicos de alimentos' ('To remain until our people have access to their basic food needs'). The artists then seal the box. They talk about the connections between art, society, and politics, as well as about their interaction with the inhabitants of marginalized communities.

=520  \\$aThe Colectivo de Acciones de Arte (CADA) is a Chilean activist group of artists (artists Lotty Rosenfeld and Juan Castillo, sociologist Fernando Balcells, poet Raúl Zurita and novelist Diamela Eltit) who used performance to challenge the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile. One of the most important contributors to the ‘Escena Avanzada’, CADA incorporated strategies of theatricality and performance as an essential element to all its ‘art actions’, while questioning the practices and institutions of all politics and conceiving art as a necessary social practice that eradicated the traditional distance between the artist and the spectator.

=520  \\$aOn October 17, 1979, eight milk trucks left the Soprole milk factory to drive through the city of Santiago according to a previously planned route, which ended at the National Museum of Fine Arts, where the trucks stood for hours forming a long line. The route symbolically connects a milk producing factory with a conservative 'art factory', the museum. This civil action sought to expose political violence, cultural censorship and human misery in a country threatened and under surveillance by Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship. The Museum was under the control of the dictatorship so the milk trucks worked as a critical reference to military technology and Pinochet’s regime. This piece indicated that art was not inside the museum but outside, dispersed in the city, clandestine.

The route symbolically connects a milk producing factory with a conservative 'art factory', the museum. This connection is further performed by closing the entrance to the Museum by covering the façade with a large white cloth. This civil action sought to expose political violence, cultural censorship, and human misery in a country threatened and under surveillance by Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship. The Museum was under the control of the dictatorship so the milk trucks worked as a critical reference to military technology and Pinochets regime. The white cloth sought to evoke and resist political repression; it indicated that art was not inside the museum but outside, dispersed in the city, clandestine. Here shown is the productive 'backstage' of the action: the workers at the milk plant packaging the milk and the milk trucks driving through the city. Then we see the long line of parked trucks in front of the Museum of Fine Arts. There is footage shot from different perspectives, including takes from the square across the street from the Museum.

One of the most important contributors to the Escena Avanzada, CADA incorporated strategies of theatricality and performance as an essential element to all its art actions, while questioning the practices and institutions of all politics and conceiving art as a necessary social practice that eradicated the traditional distance between the artist and the spectator. Committed to the foundation of an open and spontaneous practice of spectatorship, their interventions in everyday life intended to interrupt and alter the normalized routines of the daily urban life of the citizen, by means of a semiotic subversion that decontextualized and semantically restructured urban behaviors, locations and signs.
=520  \\$aOn October 17, 1979, eight milk trucks left the Soprole milk factory to drive through the city of Santiago according to a previously planned route, which ended at the National Museum of Fine Arts, where the trucks stood for hours forming a long line. The route symbolically connects a milk producing factory with a conservative 'art factory', the museum. This civil action sought to expose political violence, cultural censorship and human misery in a country threatened and under surveillance by Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship. The Museum was under the control of the dictatorship so the milk trucks worked as a critical reference to military technology and Pinochet’s regime. Covering the facade of the Museum with a white cloth, CADA indicated that art was not inside the museum but outside, dispersed in the city, clandestine.

=520  \\$a'Para no morir de hambre en el arte' is a multi-faceted 'art action' performed in 1979 addressing the problem of unsatisfied civil and human needs of the Chilean people (hunger, poverty), endowing milk with the symbolic power to represent this unrepresentable political issue. The performance consisted of several actions: passing out milk to people in Santiago's slums; parading milk trucks through the city's streets; calling attention to the performance with full-page ads in periodicals; enacting the group's message in front of the local United Nations building; altering the façade of a museum to draw it into the theme of the performance; broadcasting, through loudspeakers located outside the CEPAL building, a critical speech; and filling an acrylic box with 100 milk bags, an issue of the periodical 'HOY' and an audiotape with the broadcasted critical speech in an art gallery.
=520  \\$aShown in this video clip is a text (in Spanish) describing the work, along with camera material alternating between two actions: the artists delivering milk to the inhabitants of a 'población' (a marginalized neighborhood), and the artists sealing milk and other materials in an acrylic box inside an art gallery. The artists explain the goal of the action: CADA wanted to point out to unsatisfied civil and human needs of the Chilean people.

=520  \\$aDiamela Eltit is a distinguished Chilean performance artist, novelist and cultural critic. Winner of the Guggenheim Fellowship and numerous other awards and appointments, Eltit was a member of the acclaimed Colectivo de Acciones de Arte (CADA), a Chilean activist group of artists who used performance to challenge Pinochet's dictatorship in Chile. She has been an important cultural presence during the years of the post-dictatorship through her participation in journals such as the Revista de Crítica Cultural. Both as an artist and a critic, Eltit's work constitutes an important contribution to feminist theory and cultural debates. In 2000, she published 'Emergencias: Escritos sobre literatura, arte y política,' a book of essays which brings together some of her literary and cultural criticism. Her narrative work includes 'Lumpérica' (1983), 'Por la patria' (1986), 'El padre mío' (1989), 'El infarto del alma' (with photographer Paz Errázuriz [1994]), 'Mano de obra' (2002), 'Jamás el fuego nunca' (2007), and most recently 'Impuesto a la carne' (2010). Both individually and as a member of CADA, Diamela Eltit was one of the most important contributors to the 'Escena de Avanzada.' The goal was to perform 'interventions in everyday life' intended to interrupt and alter the normalized routines of citizens' daily urban lives by means of a semiotic subversion that decontextualized and semantically restructured urban behaviors, locations and signs.
=520  \\$aIn 'Zona de dolor' (Zone of Pain), Eltit places the body – her body – at the center of this political and social re-signification: she cuts and burns herself and then goes to a brothel, where she reads part of her novel 'Lumpérica.' Her mortified body mirrors the wounded national body, and establishes a connection between the individual and the collective, and the private and the public, exposing her physicality, her words, and her voice in communion with a space that exists at the edge of social structures. In the latter part of this video Diamela Eltit's voice accompanies her action of washing pavement in front of the brothel, collapsing the boundaries between her novel's words, her body, and the space inhabited by 'public women.' Eltit not only disrupts the space of gendered sexual transaction, but also proposes a powerful reflection upon where the 'zone of pain' might be located in a historical moment marked by sorrow and injustices.

=520  \\$aSince 1981, the Split Britches Company (founded by Lois Weaver, Peggy Shaw, and Deb Margolin, www.splitbritches.com) has written and performed in trio, duet, and solo, as well as collaborated and performed with other artists. They describe their work in this way: 'Our work is rooted in popular culture, but positioned against it. It relies on moments rather than plot, relationships rather than story. It depends on the surprise of transformation rather than the logic of psychological narrative. It straddles the line between performance and theater, exploiting theatricality while exposing the pretense. It is about a community of outsiders, queers, eccentrics. It is feminist because it encourages the imaginative potential in everyone and lesbian because it takes the presence of lesbian on stage as a given.' Their vaudevillian satirical gender-bending performances have received numerous awards, including a Jane Chamber award and four Village Voice OBIE awards. Their collection of scripts, Split Britches Feminist Performance/Lesbian Practice, edited by Sue Ellen Case, won the 1997 Lambda Literary Award for Drama. This video documents a first rehearsal of the first draft of their show Split Britches- The True Story, which marks the initial collaboration of the trio and is the show from which they got their name. Conceived and directed by Lois Weaver, its a show based on true stories of three members of Weavers family in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, United States. It also marks the beginning of the companys aesthetic: weaving multiple true stories in one, trusting the details of the everyday and relying on relation rather than action.The Christian Science Monitor called this play a tiny masterpiece.

=520  \\$aThis historical documentation features testimonies on the work of the directors and actors of the Third World Theater Series, produced by New WORLD Theater. The Third World Theater Series began in the fall of 1979 as a project of the Student Activities Office of the University of Massachusetts/Amherst. By 1981 it was in its third year and had hosted twelve visiting companies and produced four original plays. In this video, community members discuss what it takes to put on a theatre festival and present political work from multi-racial perspectives and collaborations. They offer their visions of what making 'new theater' is, and how to work with people through theater for social and political change. In line with New WORLD Theater ideals, this series promoted a racially diverse theater, political in content, and accessible to lower classes. Performances featured in the series include Homelands, And the Soul Shall Dance, Simpson Street, and Prisims.
=520  \\$aFrom 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a 'new world' - one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America's shifting demographics. From a geographic 'outpost' in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, methods, and production. One of New WORLD Theater's artistic legacies is Project 2050, an early call to imagine the U.S. demographic shift, with people of the future - youth, in equal collaboration with artists and scholars.

=520  \\$aThe Colectivo de Acciones de Arte (CADA) is a Chilean activist group of artists (artists Lotty Rosenfeld and Juan Castillo, sociologist Fernando Balcells, poet Raúl Zurita and novelist Diamela Eltit) who used performance to challenge the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile. One of the most important contributors to the ‘Escena Avanzada’, CADA incorporated strategies of theatricality and performance as an essential element to all its ‘art actions’, while questioning the practices and institutions of all politics and conceiving art as a necessary social practice that eradicated the traditional distance between the artist and the spectator. Committed to the foundation of an open and spontaneous practice of spectatorship, their ‘interventions in everyday life’ intended to interrupt and alter the normalized routines of the daily urban life of the citizen, by means of a semiotic subversion that decontextualized and semantically restructured urban behaviors, locations and signs.
=520  \\$aOn July, 12th, 1981, six small airplanes, flying in perfect formation over Santiago, dropped 400,000 flyers discussing the relationship between art and society. This action referenced the bombardment of the House of Government (La Moneda), which marked the fall of Salvador Allende's democratic government and the beginning of Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship in Chile. Through this ‘acción sobre arte y política’, CADA reconstructed the political trauma of 1973, while proposing a new critical political perspective. The flyers contained a message that simultaneously upheld each person’s right to a decent standard of living and proposed that the general public was capable of instating an entirely new concept of art - one that could overcome traditional, elite boundaries and become part of public life.

=520  \\$aThe Colectivo de Acciones de Arte (CADA) is a Chilean activist group of artists (artists Lotty Rosenfeld and Juan Castillo, sociologist Fernando Balcells, poet Raúl Zurita and novelist Diamela Eltit) who used performance to challenge the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile. One of the most important contributors to the ‘Escena Avanzada’, CADA incorporated strategies of theatricality and performance as an essential element to all its ‘art actions’, while questioning the practices and institutions of all politics and conceiving art as a necessary social practice that eradicated the traditional distance between the artist and the spectator. Committed to the foundation of an open and spontaneous practice of spectatorship, their ‘interventions in everyday life’ intended to interrupt and alter the normalized routines of the daily urban life of the citizen, by means of a semiotic subversion that decontextualized and semantically restructured urban behaviors, locations and signs.
=520  \\$aIn 1981, six small airplanes, flying in perfect formation over Santiago, dropped 400,000 flyers discussing the relationship between art and society. This action referenced the bombardment of the House of Government (La Moneda), which marked the fall of Salvador Allende's democratic government and the beginning of Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship in Chile. Through this 'acción', CADA reconstructed the political trauma of 1973, while proposing a new political perspective. The flyers contained a message that simultaneously upheld each person’s right to a decent standard of living and proposed that the general public was capable of instating an entirely new concept of art - one that could overcome traditional, elite boundaries and become part of public life. Here shown is video material from three monitors thought to comprise a video installation piece that would reflect on the performance (this installation is still a work in progress).
=520  8\$aAs a set, the images in the monitors pose a call for discussion on the still open conflict between territorial isolation, censorship, and creative alternatives to these issues. Parts 1, 2 and 3 each contain the installation material from monitors 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

=520  \\$aIn 'El fulgor de la huelga', CADA enacted a hunger strike in a small metalworking factory, which had collapsed owing to the deep economic crisis in Chile leaving all the workers unemployed. CADA's action was meant to denounce the growing unemployment among the working classes and to highlight the importance of hunger strikes as political tools and ways of resisting the economic policy of Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship.
=520  \\$aShown in this video clip is the 'backstage' of the action: the artists are preparing for the performance and discussing it. Then the video presents the performance per se: first, the artists lie on the floor, covered in blankets that read 'CADA', sleeping. Then they wake up and leave the scene one by one. The video ends with footage of the factory. The image shows no movement, making reference to the closing down of the factory.

=520  \\$aThe Colectivo de Acciones de Arte (CADA) is a Chilean activist group of artists (artists Lotty Rosenfeld and Juan Castillo, sociologist Fernando Balcells, poet Raúl Zurita, and novelist Diamela Eltit) who used performance to challenge the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile. One of the most important contributors to the 'Escena Avanzada', CADA incorporated strategies of theatricality and performance as an essential element to all its 'art actions', while questioning the practices and institutions of all politics and conceiving art as a necessary social practice that eradicated the traditional distance between the artist and the spectator. Committed to the foundation of an open and spontaneous practice of spectatorship, their 'interventions in everyday life' intended to interrupt and alter the normalized routines of the daily urban life of the citizen, by means of a semiotic subversion that decontextualized and semantically restructured urban behaviors, locations and signs.
=520  \\$aIn 'El fulgor de la huelga', CADA enacted a hunger strike in a small metalworking factory, which had collapsed owing to the deep economic crisis in Chile leaving all the workers unemployed. CADA's action was meant to denounce the growing unemployment among the working classes and to highlight the importance of hunger strikes as political tools and ways of resisting the economic policy of Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship.

=520  \\$aThe Colectivo de Acciones de Arte (CADA) is a Chilean activist group of artists (artists Lotty Rosenfeld and Juan Castillo, sociologist Fernando Balcells, poet Raúl Zurita, and novelist Diamela Eltit), who used performance to challenge the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile. One of the most important contributors to the 'Escena Avanzada', CADA incorporated strategies of theatricality and performance as an essential element to all its 'art actions', while questioning the practices and institutions of all politics and conceiving art as a necessary social practice that eradicated the traditional distance between the artist and the spectator.

=520  \\$aAs a part of their everyday interventions on art and politics in Chile, CADA established several self-financed journals to explore the theoretical questions behind 'avanzada' art. In 1982, CADA published the journal RUPTURA, printing 200 copies. This video footage shows a discussion around the journal in a meeting of artists.
=520  \\$aIn part 1, the discussion centers on the inclusion in the journal of an interview with visual artist Ernesto Muñoz. The inclusion of this interview generated a heated polemic because this artist was rejected by the liberal/leftist political milieu in which CADA participated. The interview was considered a wrong move. CADA members Raúl Zurita and Diamela Eltit defend and explain CADA's decision to publish the interview.
=520  \\$aIn part 2, they discuss the homage that the journal decided to pay to Colectivo Mural Brigada Ramona Parra, which devoted itself to the production of murals. They also discuss the status of CADA's artistic practice, which was frequently not considered as 'artistic'. Finally, they talk about the relationship of art and politics in the work of both CADA and Ramona Parra.

In a neon light factory, CADA members Juan Castillo and Raúl Zurita perform a remake of the famous duel in the American western film ‘High Noon’ (translated in Latin America as ‘A la hora señalada’). Symbolizing a physical trace of this tense and dangerous situation, the artists extended between them a neon strip illuminating the scene –a duel of light, without weapons. The reference to the film works here as a denunciation of Chilean political violence during Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship, and as an open call to utilize mourning as a productive force in the struggle for civil rights.

=520  \\$aThis is a video documentation of the writing of the poem 'La Vida Nueva' in New York City's sky. For this 'performance-acción' or ‘poesía-acción’ (‘poetry-action’), five planes drew white smoke letters silhouetted over the blue sky. The poem was written in Spanish as form of recognition for all the minority groups all over the world. The photographs of this ‘poesía-acción’ are included in the book ‘Anteparaíso’ (‘Anteparadise,’ a bilingual edition, University of California Press, 1986). Raúl Zurita (Santiago de Chile, 1950) is a poet who, along with other artists, created the group CADA, Colectivo de Acciones de Arte, in 1979. CADA developed a large format or ‘monumental’ public art, characterized for being political and as a form of resistance against Pinochet’s dictatorship. Some of Zurita’s books are ‘Purgatorio’ (1979), ‘Anteparaíso’ (1982), ‘Canto a su amor desaparecido’ (1985), ‘La Vida Nueva’ (1994), ‘INRI’ (2003) y ‘Zurita’ (2011). He has traced poems in the sky (New York, 1982), and permanently in the Atacama desert (Chile, 1993). He has received the Guggenhaim and DAAD scholarships from Germany, and has obtained awards such as the Pablo Neruda and the National Literature Award in Chile, and the José Lezama Lima Award (Cuba, 2006), among others.

=520  \\$a‘Do Lord Remember Me,’ directed by Roberta Uno, focuses on the memories of former slaves in Virginia. John De Jongh’s play was the perfect vehicle to bring together theater and music, with the collaboration of UMASS music professor Horace Boyer, and the participation of cast members from the community in Amherst. The memories of ex-slaves recorded in interviews in the 1930’s constitute the raw material of this theater piece. The lines and dialogue of this play are the words of black men and women in their eighties and nineties, who remember their experience of the ‘peculiar institution’ as it happened to them nearly a lifetime ago. Characters in the play adopt different personalities, telling the stories/histories of other slaves’ experiences, and expressing the oppressions of serving in the military, inter-racial relationships, and the black/white social power dynamic. Among these horrors, faith sustained them and infused their desire for survival, always holding the promise that in the future they will be free: ‘On my way to heaven, Lord remember me … do Lord, do Lord, do Lord remember me.’
=520  \\$aFrom 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a ‘new world’ - one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting demographics. From a geographic ‘outpost’ in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, methods, and production. One of New WORLD Theater’s artistic legacies is Project 2050, an early call to imagine the U.S. demographic shift, with people of the future - youth, in equal collaboration with artists and scholars.

=520  \\$aThe Colectivo de Acciones de Arte (CADA) is a Chilean activist group of artists (artists Lotty Rosenfeld and Juan Castillo, sociologist Fernando Balcells, poet Raúl Zurita and novelist Diamela Eltit) who used performance to challenge the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile. One of the most important contributors to the ‘Escena Avanzada’, CADA incorporated strategies of theatricality and performance as an essential element to all its ‘art actions’, while questioning the practices and institutions of all politics and conceiving art as a necessary social practice that eradicated the traditional distance between the artist and the spectator. Committed to the foundation of an open and spontaneous practice of spectatorship, their ‘interventions in everyday life’ intended to interrupt and alter the normalized routines of the daily urban life of the citizen, by means of a semiotic subversion that decontextualized and semantically restructured urban behaviors, locations and signs.
=520  \\$aIn 1983, the 10th year of Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship in Chile, CADA proposed the slogan 'NO +' (NO more). This was meant as an open text to be completed by the citizens, according to their specific social demands (No more ...). CADA invited Chilean artists from different fields to spread this message on walls all over Santiago. Wall tagging was the first form of NO+, but the slogan was soon used by different collectives all over the country as a massive public symbol of political resistance and non-conformity.
=520  \\$aShown in this video clip is a 'Making Of' documentary, including a synopsis of the project (in Spanish), footage of the first NO+ actions in the Mapocho river in Santiago, and a series of slides (showing diverse actions, protests, plays, and wall tags) evidencing multiple appropriations and uses of the slogan for political intervention in the public sphere.

They describe their work in this way: 'Our work is rooted in popular culture, but positioned against it. It relies on moments rather than plot, relationships rather than story. It depends on the surprise of transformation rather than the logic of psychological narrative. It straddles the line between performance and theater, exploiting theatricality while exposing the pretense. It is about a community of outsiders, queers, eccentrics. It is feminist because it encourages the imaginative potential in everyone and lesbian because it takes the presence of lesbian on stage as a given.' Their vaudevillian satirical gender-bending performances have received numerous awards, including a Jane Chamber award and four Village Voice OBIE awards. Their collection of scripts, Split Britches Feminist Performance/Lesbian Practice, edited by Sue Ellen Case, won the 1997 Lambda Literary Award for Drama. This video documents the first version of their show Beauty and the Beast. Based on the classic fairy tale, influenced by the long rule of republican politics and informed by the Christian agenda that dominates the US scene up till the present, it is the personal journey of a Salvation Army woman who plays the good and beautiful daughter who secretly wants to be bad, a Rabbi in pink toe shoes who is relegated to the role of the father and longs to be a stand-up comic, and an 86-year-old lesbian vaudeville freak who embraces the role of the Beast and comments on politics by forgetting which play she is in.

=520  \\$aVideo excerpts of this play. We see the backstage of a theatrical production. They are planning to do a rehearsal. The play shows the tensions and conflicts within the creative group as the debut approaches. They are staging a play about the conquest of America. Some of the actors seem to be very frustrated with the play and with their career. The play also shows the connections between theater and political interests and pressures (the group is the National Company of Theater). The director hires a group of Indigenous people to perform as Indians from the time of the Conquest. They refuse to perform without being paid and so the play becomes a mess. This is the first in a series of disturbances (most of them associated with political issues) that interrupts and threatens to ruin the rehearsals and the debut of the piece. This play represents an exercise in meta-theater by this experienced theater group, a fast-moving mixture of comedy and a rather serious consideration of the relationship between art and politics. La Candelaria (www.teatrolacandelaria.org.co) was founded in 1966 by a group of independent artists and intellectuals who came from experimental theater and the broader Colombian cultural movement. Directed by Santiago García, La Candelaria is one of Colombian theater's most innovative agents, modernizing national drama while addressing popular audiences. By means of an ongoing exploration of national folklore, situations and characters, they have created some of Colombia's most compelling plays, some of them through the method of 'creación colectiva' ('collective creation'), addressing the acute social and political problems of their society. At the same time, they fostered the creation of Corporación Colombiana del Teatro and have developed a number of theoretical works that reflect upon dramatic creation, its methods and languages. Still nowadays, La Candelaria is committed to repertoire, experimentation, and discussion as fundamental elements to artistic creation.

It also marks the beginning of the companys aesthetic: weaving multiple true stories in one, trusting the details of the everyday and relying on relation rather than action. The Christian Science Monitor called this play a tiny masterpiece.

=520  \\$aFirst experimental video created by the Border Arts Workshop/Taller de Arte Fronterizo, of which Guillermo Gómez-Peña was a founding member. Some of the original members of this binational collective -concerned with 'border-crossing' and centred in the border-region around Tijuana and San Diego- collaboratively created this video art piece, intertwining footage of the Tijuana/San Diego border with excerpts of street performances, along with text written and narrated by Gómez-Peña. La Pocha Nostra (www.pochanostra.com) is an ever-morphing trans-disciplinary arts organization, founded in 1993 by Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Roberto Sifuentes, and Nola Mariano in California. The objective was to formally conceptualize Gómez-Peña's collaborations with other performance artists. It provides a base (and forum) for a loose network of rebel artists from various disciplines, generations and ethnic backgrounds, whose common denominator is the desire to cross and erase dangerous borders between art and politics, practice and theory, artist and spectator. As of June 2006, members include performance artists Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Violeta Luna, Michelle Ceballos, and Roberto Sifuentes; curators Gabriela Salgado and Orlando Britto; and over thirty associates worldwide in countries such as Mexico, Spain, the UK, and Australia. Projects range from performance solos and duets to large-scale performance installations including video, photography, audio, and cyber-art. La Pocha collaborates across national borders, race, gender and generations. Their collaborative model functions both as an act of citizen diplomacy and as a means to create ephemeral communities of like-minded rebels. The basic premise of these collaborations is founded on an ideal: If we learn to cross borders on stage, we may learn how to do so in larger social spheres. La Pocha strives to eradicate myths of purity and dissolve borders surrounding culture, ethnicity, gender, language, and métier. These are radical acts.

=520  \\$aRosa Luisa Márquez (www.marquezmartorell.org) is a Puerto Rican theater artist and pedagogue; she specializes in contemporary theater. Rosa Luisa started her teaching career at the theater department of the University of Puerto Rico in 1978. She developed the current curriculum of Drama Activities, which she teaches in her workshops at schools, prisons, rehab centers, women's shelters and community centers. Her directing projects include 'Romeo(s) y Julieta(s),' 'Historias para ser Contadas,' 'La Leyenda del Cemí,' 'Procesión,' 'Waiting for Godot,' 'Jardín de Pulpos,' 'Absurdos en Soledad,' 'El León y la Joya,' among others. Published books include 'Brincos y saltos: el juego como disciplina teatral' and 'Historias para ser contadas, montaje de Rosa Luisa Márquez.' She is a member of the board of directors and pedagogical team for the EITALC's International School of Latin American and Caribbean Theater. Ongoing artistic collaborators include Gilda Navarra and Antonio Martorell (Puerto Rico), Grupo Malayerba (Ecuador), Grupo Yuyachkani (Peru), and directors Peter Shumann (Bread & Puppet Theater, U.S.A.) and Augusto Boal (Theater of the Oppressed, Brazil). 'La Marcha de la Plena Verdad' is Márquez's first graphic-theatrical collaboration with renowned visual artist Antonio Martorell. Created with Puerto Rican historian Lydia Milagros González, and with a turnout of over 120 participants, this public demonstration condemned the political intervention of the United States in Nicaragua. Willie Colón's 'La era nuclear' is the theme song showcased in this video, which documents the diverse masks, puppets, banners and other artistic strategies developed by 'Taller de la Escarcha' in order to claim a cease and desist of American political interventions in Central America.

=520  \\$aThe Colectivo de Acciones de Arte (CADA) is a Chilean activist group of artists (artists Lotty Rosenfeld and Juan Castillo, sociologist Fernando Balcells, poet Raúl Zurita and novelist Diamela Eltit) who used performance to challenge the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile. One of the most important contributors to the ‘Escena Avanzada’, CADA incorporated strategies of theatricality and performance as an essential element to all its ‘art actions’, while questioning the practices and institutions of all politics and conceiving art as a necessary social practice that eradicated the traditional distance between the artist and the spectator. Committed to the foundation of an open and spontaneous practice of spectatorship, their ‘interventions in everyday life’ intended to interrupt and alter the normalized routines of the daily urban life of the citizen, by means of a semiotic subversion that decontextualized and semantically restructured urban behaviors, locations and signs.
=520  \\$aIn September 1985, CADA produced a portrait of a woman whose husband had been killed in a political demonstration against the dictatorship in Chile; they accompanied the image with the following text: ‘Mirar su gesto extremo y popular. Prestar atención a su viudez y sobreviviencia. Entender a un pueblo.’ (‘To look at her gesture, extreme and popular. To pay attention to her widowhood and survival. To understand a people’). They published this work in several journals (‘Análisis’, ‘Cauce’, ‘Hoy’) and in the newspaper ‘Fortín Mapocho’, all critical of Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship. This art intervention was meant to celebrate civil protests against the dictatorship; these protests were brutally repressed by the government. ‘Viuda’ was meant to refer to this political situation, while pointing to women as surviving social subjects who remained in charge of entire families and homes after the disappearance of their husbands.

=520  \\$aVideo excerpts of this theater piece recreating the drama of a Conquistador, spellbound by American exuberance, who returns to his country defeated and sick, just to be punished and forced to keep looking for El Dorado.We see one of the Spanish conquerors in his last days. He is haunted by several ghosts (his father, his mother, a woman) who tell him to go to America to do great deeds and become rich. One by one, all the ghosts from the past come to pay a visit and judge him. This is one of La Candelaria's plays concerned with the violent conquest of America, but it focuses on the conquerors, their miseries and their dreams. La Candelaria (www.teatrolacandelaria.org.co) was founded in 1966 by a group of independent artists and intellectuals who came from experimental theater and the broader Colombian cultural movement. Directed by Santiago García, La Candelaria is one of Colombian theater's most innovative agents, modernizing national drama while addressing popular audiences. By means of an ongoing exploration of national folklore, situations and characters, they have created some of Colombia's most compelling plays, some of them through the method of 'creación colectiva' ('collective creation'), addressing the acute social and political problems of their society. At the same time, they fostered the creation of Corporación Colombiana del Teatro and have developed a number of theoretical works that reflect upon dramatic creation, its methods and languages. Still nowadays, La Candelaria is committed to repertoire, experimentation, and discussion as fundamental elements to artistic creation.

=518  \\$aPerformed in Porto Alegre, Brazil, on June 14, 1986.
=520  \\$aThis staging of Genet's The Maids focuses on the relationships of exploitation and subservience that inform the class differences between the two maids and their rich mistress. The production emphasizes the theme of a feminine universe subjugated to an essentially macho society by having the female characters be played by men. The set - chairs for the audience, a double bed, a wardrobe, and a dresser with a mirror - is decorated with flowers, satin drapes, an altar for a saint that stands for the mistress, and a large painting of a phallus. The staging takes place as a mystic-erotic ceremony, and the entire configuration of the furniture is phallic. In the role playing games the maids play, the ambiguities in their relationship to their mistress become obvious. They are connected to her image by affection, erotism, and hatred, while they nurture a deep feeling of contempt for each other, since they see in each other what they really are. Their greatest desire is not to eliminate the class to which their mistress belongs, but rather to occupy her place in society.
=520  \\$aBased in Porto Alegre, The Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz was born in 1978 out of a desire for a radical renovation of the language of theatre. During the several years of their existence, they have created a personal aesthetics founded upon the authorial work of the actor, both on the stage and on the streets. Their venue, the Terreira da Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, works as a community theatre school, offering several free workshops open to the public. Their tribal organization is based on the principle of collective work, both in the creative process and in the maintenance of the space. For Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, theater is an instrument for both revealing and analyzing reality, and it's function is social: to contribute to the collective knowledge and to the improvement of the quality of life of the people. In a world marked by exclusion, marginalization, homogenization, by dehumanizing and barbaric efforts, they see it as their moral imperative to denounce injustice, sold opinions, authoritarianism, mediocrity and the erasing of memory. Ói Nóis sees theatre as an art of resistance, in the service of arts and politics, an art that does not fit the market patterns for ethics and aesthetics. Instead, they see theater as a way of life and as a vehicle for ideas: a theater that does not comment on life, but that takes part in it.

=520  \\$aRosa Luisa Márquez (www.marquezmartorell.org) is a Puerto Rican theater artist and pedagogue; she specializes in contemporary theater. Rosa Luisa started her teaching career at the theater department of the University of Puerto Rico in 1978. She developed the current curriculum of Drama Activities, which she teaches in her workshops at schools, prisons, rehab centers, women's shelters and community centers. Her directing projects include 'Romeo(s) y Julieta(s),' 'Historias para ser Contadas,' 'La Leyenda del Cemí,' 'Procesión,' 'Waiting for Godot,' 'Jardín de Pulpos,' 'Absurdos en Soledad,' 'El León y la Joya,' among others. Published books include 'Brincos y saltos: el juego como disciplina teatral' and 'Historias para ser contadas, montaje de Rosa Luisa Márquez.' She is a member of the board of directors and pedagogical team for the EITALC's International School of Latin American and Caribbean Theater. Ongoing artistic collaborators include Gilda Navarra and Antonio Martorell (Puerto Rico), Grupo Malayerba (Ecuador), Grupo Yuyachkani (Peru), and directors Peter Shumann (Bread & Puppet Theater, U.S.A.) and Augusto Boal (Theater of the Oppressed, Brazil). In conjunction with visual artist Antonio Martorell, she created the concept of 'Teatreros Ambulantes' (Itinerant Performers, 1987-1990), resulting in twelve productions. 'La Leyenda del Cemí' was created by Márquez in collaboration with Puerto Rican artist Oscar Mestey as a final project with her students of the course 'Drama Activities' at the University of Puerto Rico. Based on the eponymous story by writer Kalman Barsy, the piece tells a mythical account of the birth of the island of Puerto Rico. Indigenous Taíno iconography, performing objects made of everyday artifacts, experimental storytelling, live music and infectious Caribbean rhythms create a submarine world where sea creatures join together to reshape the Earth, fulfilling an island's secret dream. This piece consolidated the group of students who later became the Teatreros Ambulantes.

=520  \\$aStephen Newby composed and conducted the Vocal Jazz and Afroamerican Ensemble in the gospel/jazz oratorio ‘Be Still and Know.’ With the direction of Roberta Uno, this performance stages the space of the church, and the choir’s voices, as site for political discussion on identity matters, given that the multicultural and multiracial ensemble melts musically in harmony. The chorus ‘Be still and know that I am God,’ is not only a calling on people and children to put their faith and trust in God, but mostly an invitation to learning and sharing through voices, music, and sound.
=520  \\$aFrom 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a ‘new world’ - one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting demographics. From a geographic ‘outpost’ in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, methods, and production. One of New WORLD Theater’s artistic legacies is Project 2050, an early call to imagine the U.S. demographic shift, with people of the future - youth, in equal collaboration with artists and scholars.

=520  \\$aFirst theater piece by Teatro La Máscara, 'Noticias de María' is composed of two skits exploring feminine issues from the perspective of education and matrimony. 'María M.' emphasizes the sense of confinement a woman feels in her marriage, where her role as a wife is idealized in order to mask the submissive behavior expected by her husband; Maria M. is driven to madness (we find her in a psychiatric ward) and ultimately to death, rather than to return to her married life. 'Maria Adelia' portrays the adolescent world in a religious school, where young women are taught the cultural expectations of division of roles between men and women in society. Overall, 'Noticias de María' poses a feminist critique to women's passive acceptance of a gendered 'destiny' determined by a 'machista' society. Teatro La Máscara is the oldest - and one of the only - feminist, all-women's theater in Colombia. Founded in 1972 in Cali, La Máscara was a political theater initially comprised of male as well as female actors; by the early 1980s, when only the women stayed and wanted to continue the theatrical trajectory of the group, Lucy Bolaños decided to make La Máscara a women's ensemble fully dedicated to a feminine dramaturgy on gender issues. Committed to feminism and social change, they have stayed true to this mission, despite the many social and economic pressures they've had to endure in an environment plagued by violence and machismo, which constantly seeks to 'invisibilize' their work. Because of their fruitful stubbornness, La Máscara is not only creating and staging plays, but also working with marginalized communities, actively participating in political protests and demonstrations, and being involved in the organization of theater festivals. Through their work, they keep re-thinking women's role in the construction of a peaceful Colombia.

They describe their work in this way: 'Our work is rooted in popular culture, but positioned against it. It relies on moments rather than plot, relationships rather than story. It depends on the surprise of transformation rather than the logic of psychological narrative. It straddles the line between performance and theater, exploiting theatricality while exposing the pretense. It is about a community of outsiders, queers, eccentrics. It is feminist because it encourages the imaginative potential in everyone and lesbian because it takes the presence of lesbian on stage as a given.' Their vaudevillian satirical gender-bending performances have received numerous awards, including a Jane Chamber award and four Village Voice OBIE awards. Their collection of scripts, Split Britches Feminist Performance/Lesbian Practice, edited by Sue Ellen Case, won the 1997 Lambda Literary Award for Drama. This video documents their show Upwardly Mobile Home. Originally produced at WOW Café on East 11th Street, New York City in 1984, this version is a revived performance at WOW Café on 4th Street in 1986. The piece is a working class survival story, where a troupe of actors camps out under the Brooklyn bridge and peddle their wares, trying unsuccessfully to sell out and be greedy like the rest of America in the 1980s.

=520  \\$aBased in Porto Alegre, The Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz was born in 1978 out of a desire for a radical renovation of the language of theatre. During the several years of their existence, they have created a personal aesthetics founded upon the authorial work of the actor, both on the stage and on the streets. Their venue, the Terreira da Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, works as a community theatre school, offering several free workshops open to the public. Their tribal organization is based on the principle of collective work, both in the creative process and in the maintenance of the space. For Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, theater is an instrument for both revealing and analyzing reality, and it's function is social: to contribute to the collective knowledge and to the improvement of the quality of life of the people. In a world marked by exclusion, marginalization, homogenization, by dehumanizing and barbaric efforts, they see it as their moral imperative to denounce injustice, sold opinions, authoritarianism, mediocrity and the erasing of memory. Ói Nóis sees theatre as an art of resistance, in the service of arts and politics, an art that does not fit the market patterns for ethics and aesthetics. Instead, they see theater as a way of life and as a vehicle for ideas: a theater that does not comment on life, but that takes part in it.
=520  \\$aIn this staging of Beckett's Endgame, the audience has to cross a long tunnel covered in zinc plates to arrive at the desolating image of the four characters, physically limited and trapped in between walls of zinc, consumed by relationships of anguish and resentment. There is a silent and desperate pact between them, where Hamm is the despot who gives the orders which Clov obeys, but it is Clov who determines if the game goes on or not, since he could leave at any time and the others would die. The whole story revolves around the fear that he may leave, but he doesn't, because there is nowhere to go. Even in the end, when he ceases to answer the request of the blind Hamm, Clov stands by his side, still and silent, with a suitcase in hand. Everything ends as it began, and nothing happens.

=520  \\$aCorridos: Tales of Passion and Revolution, nationally broadcast on PBS and the winner of the George Peabody for excellence in Television in 1987, was the final result of the El Teatro Campesino's stage production of the same name. The piece began as a five week workshop in ETC's San Juan Bautista playhouse in the summer of 1982, exploring the stories and narrative lyrics of Mexican popular ballads or corridos. The workshop production was an instant popular success with audiences and critics. ETC decided to stage a new production of Corridos at the Marines Memorial Theater in San Francisco, where it ran for three months to great reviews and eleven Bay Area Critics Awards. Other stagings followed in 1984. Corridos finally evolved into a full-fledged video production in 1987, after several drafts of the script that not only reworked the selection of ballads, but also condensed the material to fit into the confines of a one-hour special. The production presents two full-length corridos: Delgadina (a haunting parable of incest in a wealthy Mexican family), and Soldadera (based on the dispatches of American journalist John Reed, in which the compelling story of Elizabeta is framed by three songs of women during the 1910 Mexican Revolution). Highlights from other traditional corridos are connected by engaging narrative sequences: Yo soy El Corrido (the story of the corrido itself), Rosita Alvirez (a comedic parable of a defiant young woman who meets an early death), and El Lavaplatos (the story of an immigrant who dreams of becoming a movie star and ends up a dishwasher). Joining members of the original cast, the production included popular songstress Linda Ronstadt, singer/actor Daniel Valdez, San Francisco Ballet artist Evelyn Cisneros, and actor Clancy Brown.

=520  \\$aFounded in 1965 by Luis Valdez, El Teatro Campesino was initially the cultural wing of the United Farm Workers union in California's central valley. With a pointed political mission, ETC performed their actos in the fields, agitprop improvisations communicated eloquently with the workers, who could neither read nor write, but recognized themselves and their values in the actos. By 1970 ETC had gained an international reputation, with major contributions to Chicano culture in the U.S. and to the development and expansion of the boundaries of theater everywhere. Theirs is a popular theater rooted in the American streets, early California history, Mayan/Aztec mythology and Mexican folklore and spiritualism, all geared toward expression of social, political and cultural perceptions. Valdez believes in a total theaterone where an elevation of sensation is achieved through a trinity of music, dance and drama to stimulate a New American Audience, a celebration of cultural diversity. This video documents ETCs Young Actors Ensemble workshop-created piece El Fin del Mundo. Created specifically for the Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead), Fin del Mundo tells the story of character Mundo Mata (from the eponymous ETC play), who overdoses on drugs and goes to the land of the dead where he encounters his former acquaintances. They are all stuck in the afterworld repeating the vices and sins of their lives. Mundo's friends try to convince him to take over the world of the dead. This workshop was attended by children and teenagers ranging from ages 9 to 17. In some ways, then, in the context of its young performers, the production can be seen as an anti-drug piece. The training and style related to this piece left an indelible mark on later works by workshop participants, including Kinan Valdez, who has since then directed a number of ETC productions.

=520  \\$aThis piece is based on the traditional Afro-Peruvian street masquerade dance 'Son de los Diablos,' originated in the Corpus Christi celebrations in Lima during the Colonial Period. As the ruling elite in colonial Peru framed it, blacks represented evil forces in a religious drama. However, by the time of slavery's abolition in 1854, Afro-Peruvians had appropriated this dance as a symbol of cultural resistance and practiced it especially during carnival in the barrios where these were relocated. The Son was banned from the streets 1940s when President Manuel Prado prohibited carnival celebrations in Lima. In the 1980's the Movimiento Negro Francisco Congo, a collective dedicated to the recovery and revalorization of Afro-Peruvian traditions, approached Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani to recuperate the tradition of this street dance and to perform it on the streets once again. The group of Francisco Congo would teach the dance, and Yuyachkani would contribute their maskwork. Yuyachkani considered this dance a master dance for young actors because it includes codification of the body, maskwork, dancing, and an active and playful relationship with the audience. Peru's most important theatre collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani (www.yuyachkani.org) has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. 'Yuyachkani' is a Quechua word that means 'I am thinking, I am remembering'; under this name, the theatre group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru. The group is comprised of seven actors (Augusto Casafranca, Amiel Cayo, Ana Correa, Débora Correa, Rebeca Ralli, Teresa Ralli, and Julián Vargas), a technical designer (Fidel Melquíades), and an artistic director (Miguel Rubio), who have made a commitment to collective creation as a mode of theatrical production and to group theater as a life style. Their work has been among the most important in Latin America's so called 'New Popular Theater,' with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy. Yuyachkani won Peru's National Human Rights Award in 2000. Known for its creative embrace of both indigenous performance forms as well as cosmopolitan theatrical forms, Yuyachkani offers insight into Peruvian and Latin American theatre, and to broader issues of postcolonial social aesthetics.

=520  \\$aInterview with Spaniard actress and Malayerba founding member María del Rosario 'Charo' Francés, in the context of their play 'La Fanesca' performed at the Festival Iberoamericano de Teatro (FIT) de Cádiz, held in Spain in 1987. In this interview, Charo talks about the origins and creative process of 'La Fanesca,' as well as the history of the Malayerba theater group. The actress also comments on the reception of the play by Latin American audiences and on the experience of performing this play in Europe in the context of the Festival. Francés discusses issues of collective creation and political and artistic investigation at the Malayerba, as well as the role migration and exile have played in the life of the group, both as a concrete life experience for the actors and as a topic for their interventions in Ecuadorian theater and society. The actress illustrates these topics through her impressions of being a Spaniard exiled in Quito, doing Ecuadorian theater that is, in turn, performed in Spain. This interview is invaluable documentation of the early stages of this renowned theater group, one of the most important theater ensembles and actor laboratories in Latin America. The Grupo de Teatro Malayerba (teatromalayerba.org) was founded in Quito in 1979 by Arístides Vargas, Susana Pautasso and María del Rosario 'Charo' Francés, immigrant actors originally from Argentina and Spain. From the start, Malayerba included actors with various backgrounds and nationalities, invested in the exploration of the rich cultural diversity and complex history of Ecuador, as well as issues of migration, exile, political violence and individual and collective memory. With over 25 years of ongoing theater practice and more than 20 plays performed locally and internationally for a diverse audience, Malayerba is committed to theater pedagogy and experimentation, artistic collaboration, and community building. They have represented Ecuador in national and international theater festivals; they have also collaborated with theater groups within Ecuador and in other countries, and performed for both film and television, while engaging in community work in Quito. In 1989 the group created the Laboratorio Malayerba, committed to the training of generations of young Ecuadorian actors and to an ongoing investigation of theories and practices of experimental theater. In 2001 Malayerba launched the theater journal 'Hoja de Teatro,' conceived as a forum for the theorization, criticism and dissemination of Ecuadorian theater practices. The group also runs a theater house, the Casa Malayerba, which houses the Laboratory as well as a theater with seating capacity for seventy people. Malayerba approaches theater making as an artistic, ethical and technical realm where to engage in meaningful creative experiences through which to understand, assume and confront current sociopolitical processes. In working together, actors with various backgrounds and nationalities have shown that a multicultural blend is not only possible but also enriching, as differences lead to new identities, embodiments of dreams, memories, absences and pains that are at once local and universal.

Published books include 'Brincos y saltos: el juego como disciplina teatral' and 'Historias para ser contadas, montaje de Rosa Luisa Márquez.' She is a member of the board of directors and pedagogical team for the EITALC's International School of Latin American and Caribbean Theater. Ongoing artistic collaborators include Gilda Navarra and Antonio Martorell (Puerto Rico), Grupo Malayerba (Ecuador), Grupo Yuyachkani (Peru), and directors Peter Shumann (Bread & Puppet Theater, U.S.A.) and Augusto Boal (Theater of the Oppressed, Brazil). In conjunction with visual artist Antonio Martorell, she created the concept of 'Teatreros Ambulantes' (Itinerant Performers, 1987-1990), resulting in twelve productions. 'Otra Maldad de Pateco,' here showcased, is one of these projects. Based on a text by renowned Puerto Rican writer Ana Lydia Vega, this recording for television portrays the story of a child of a slave owner family; born with a white body and black head, Pateco needs to decide where his allegiance lies. As explained by Márquez in the video, Afro Caribbean characters and Puerto Rican traditional games and crafts are incorporated to the performance as a social and pedagogical intervention in the public sphere aiming to open up a discussion on race while rendering drama activities and traditional stories accessible to the Puerto Rican population.

Ligia Elena está contenta is one of these projects. Inspired by Augusto Boals forum theater and Rubén Blades eponymous song, the piece is an unveiling and exploration of issues of racism and moral double-standards at play in Puerto Rican society regarding biracial couples. After proposing a situational plot and a set of characters, the performers invite the audience to join them onstage to act the part of the victimized or oppressed character in order to search for possible solutions to the conflict and to transform the situation from within.

'La mujer ideal' is one of these projects. Performed at the University of Puerto Rico, Cayey Campus' cafeteria on the International Women's Day (March 8th, 1987), the piece is a collective creation on the media depictions of women as objects of desire and consumption. By parodically exposing advertisement's slogans and social preconceptions of beauty, womanhood and desire, the performance is an open call to critical thinking and discussion on the social codes concerning gender, objectification and consumption at play in Puerto Rican society.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of Manuel Mendive's 'Para el ojo que mira,' an interdisciplinary performance held at the opening of Mendive's eponymous art exhibit at the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes in Havana in August of 1987. An ambitious, syncretic, critically acclaimed show that included mixed media paintings, sculptures, masks, and performance, 'Para el ojo que mira' opened with an exuberant public body art performance created by Mendive, with the participation of musicians and dancers from the Conjunto Folklórico Nacional and the Danza Nacional de Cuba, along with the guest appearance of Lázaro Ross, one of the most important contemporary interpreters of Yoruba music in this Caribbean island. This video documentation was directed by Lourdes Prieto. Manuel Mendive Hoyo (www.mendive.cult.cu) is perhaps the single most important Cuban artist today. Mendive, a major exponent of contemporary 'Afro-cubanismo' in the visual arts, was born in 1944 into a Santería-practicing family. He graduated from the prestigious Academia de Artes Plásticas San Alejandro in Havana in 1962 with honors in sculpture and painting. He held his first one-man show at the Center of Art in Havana in 1964. Since then he has exhibited in some of the most important international venues. The Cuban booth at the XLII International Biennial Exhibition of Modern Art in Venice in 1988 was completely dedicated to his works. His work can be found in Museums and galleries in many countries including the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes in Havana, the Musee d'Art Moderne in Paris; as well as museums in Russia, Somalia, Congo, Norway, Denmark, Finland and the U.S and other countries. He is well-known not only for his painting and soft sculpture, but for his performance pieces in which he paints dancers' naked bodies and creates theatrical backdrops and environments. Representing an important strain of Cuban life, Mendive's multi-media work reflects his syncretic take on religion, philosophy, ethnography, art and dance.

=520  \\$a'La Fanesca' is one of the very first plays created by Ecuadorian theater group Malayerba. Collectively created in 1984 under the direction of founding member Susana Pautasso, the play is based on texts by María Escudero. A 'fanesca' is a traditional Ecuadorian dish, a rich soup made of a variety of ingredients, typically prepared and served only in the week before Easter; this play is inspired on this traditional dish, bringing together carnivalesque characters from the diversity of cultures and ethnicities present in Ecuadorian society. The performance portrays, by means of the masked voices of society's underdogs, the fractured, unofficial history of Ecuador and its rich cultural heritage as a 'mezcla de todo' (a 'mixture of everything'): the diverse worldviews, cultures, and backgrounds, not only of native Ecuadorians but also of the migrants and exiles assimilated - or not - to Ecuadorian society. This video documents the performance of 'La Fanesca' as presented in the Festival Iberoamericano de Teatro (FIT) de Cádiz, held in Spain in 1987. The Grupo de Teatro Malayerba (teatromalayerba.org) was founded in Quito in 1979 by Arístides Vargas, Susana Pautasso and María del Rosario 'Charo' Francés, immigrant actors originally from Argentina and Spain. From the start, Malayerba included actors with various backgrounds and nationalities, invested in the exploration of the rich cultural diversity and complex history of Ecuador, as well as issues of migration, exile, political violence and individual and collective memory. With over 25 years of ongoing theater practice and more than 20 plays performed locally and internationally for a diverse audience, Malayerba is committed to theater pedagogy and experimentation, artistic collaboration, and community building. They have represented Ecuador in national and international theater festivals; they have also collaborated with theater groups within Ecuador and in other countries, and performed for both film and television, while engaging in community work in Quito. In 1989 the group created the Laboratorio Malayerba, committed to the training of generations of young Ecuadorian actors and to an ongoing investigation of theories and practices of experimental theater. In 2001 Malayerba launched the theater journal 'Hoja de Teatro,' conceived as a forum for the theorization, criticism and dissemination of Ecuadorian theater practices. The group also runs a theater house, the Casa Malayerba, which houses the Laboratory as well as a theater with seating capacity for seventy people. Malayerba approaches theater making as an artistic, ethical and technical realm where to engage in meaningful creative experiences through which to understand, assume and confront current sociopolitical processes. In working together, actors with various backgrounds and nationalities have shown that a multicultural blend is not only possible but also enriching, as differences lead to new identities, embodiments of dreams, memories, absences and pains that are at once local and universal.

=520  \\$a'Donna Giovanni', Jesusa Rodríguez's adaptation for the theater of Mozart and Da Ponte's opera 'Don Giovanni', is a renowned feminist rendition of the classic by Mexican theater company Divas A.C. Directed by Rodríguez and with musical direction by Alberto Cruzprieto, the play successfully toured Latin America, the United States and Europe, receiving much critical acclaim. 'Donna Giovanni' masterfully utilizes humor, overlapping layers of cross-dressing, and the interplay between music, wordplay and tableaux vivants in order to pose a feminist commentary on sensuality, gender issues, and religious and cultural scenarios of love, deceit, empowerment and desire. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodríguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a 'chameleon,' Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. 
=520  \\$aHer 'espectáculos' (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and 'carpa,' to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguez's energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics.   
=520  \\$aLiliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: 'I am going to die with that woman.' Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. In this off-off space, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas, Jesusa y Liliana have produced hundreds of shows since the 1980s.

=520  \\$a'Migrants! Cantata a los emigrantes' is a bilingual play with music celebrating the Puerto Rican pioneers who established communities in the United States and struggled for the preservation of their culture. At the time the play was created there were 2.6 million Puerto Ricans in the United States, with 1.6 million in New York alone. Puerto Ricans have been pushed and pulled ever since the United States took the island in 1898. Some have stayed and given birth to a second and third generation; some have returned to the island and others are still in never ending transit between here and there. With this collective creation, Pregones weaves through various social, historical, economical and personal factors that have influenced their migratory process. 'Migrants' is Pregones' homage to the courage and endurance of those who came and worked before us. The play was created collectively by Pregones Theater, based on written and oral history, interviews and the works of writers such as Guillermo Boralt, René Marqués and Klemente Soto Beles. It was premiered at Pregones Theater at St. Ann's in The Bronx, NY, in December 1986. Founded in 1979 and based in The Bronx, New York City, Pregones Theater (http://www.pregones.org) has performed in more than 400 cities and 13 countries. The company enjoys citywide recognition for their lasting contributions to the performing arts field and are recipients of numerous distinctions including current Leading National Ensemble Theatre Designation from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Primary Cultural Institution Designation from the New York State Council on the Arts, the New York State Governor's Arts Award, the Culture & Humanities Award from the Center for Puerto Rican Studies, numerous artist and production awards, as well as invitations to appear at international festivals and events. Over the years Pregones has developed a style that combines theater, music and movement, oral and written traditions, and a signature urban sensibility. The ensemble draws from popular Puerto Rican artistic expressions and literature to create and stage its work. Today, Pregones has grown to be one of the leading Puerto Rican/Latino theater theaters in the United States. From migrations to indigenous mythologies to subway stories, the company's repertoire covers a growing sample of Latino experiences and identities.

=520  \\$aIn Ostal the audience of only twenty people is guided through a dark tunnel by a doctor, one by one, to the room of a patient, nearly completely occupied by an enormous bed. Once the last audience member enters, the doctor locks the door behind them. The performance takes place in this closed room, fragments from the life of a women tormented by mental illness. Her schizophrenia is portrayed not as a clinical disease, but as an inevitable consequence of the process of social adaptation we are all submitted to since childhood. In search for her identity, she seeks complicity from the audience, while all sorts of strange and violent things happen to her and to the room, without one word being said.
=520  \\$aBased in Porto Alegre, The Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz was born in 1978 out of a desire for a radical renovation of the language of theatre. During the several years of their existence, they have created a personal aesthetics founded upon the authorial work of the actor, both on the stage and on the streets. Their venue, the Terreira da Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, works as a community theatre school, offering several free workshops open to the public. Their tribal organization is based on the principle of collective work, both in the creative process and in the maintenance of the space. For Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, theater is an instrument for both revealing and analyzing reality, and it's function is social: to contribute to the collective knowledge and to the improvement of the quality of life of the people. In a world marked by exclusion, marginalization, homogenization, by dehumanizing and barbaric efforts, they see it as their moral imperative to denounce injustice, sold opinions, authoritarianism, mediocrity and the erasing of memory. Ói Nóis sees theatre as an art of resistance, in the service of arts and politics, an art that does not fit the market patterns for ethics and aesthetics. Instead, they see theater as a way of life and as a vehicle for ideas: a theater that does not comment on life, but that takes part in it.

=520  \\$aSince 1981, the Split Britches Company (founded by Lois Weaver, Peggy Shaw, and Deb Margolin, www.splitbritches.com) has written and performed in trio, duet, and solo, as well as collaborated and performed with other artists. They describe their work in this way: 'Our work is rooted in popular culture, but positioned against it. It relies on moments rather than plot, relationships rather than story. It depends on the surprise of transformation rather than the logic of psychological narrative. It straddles the line between performance and theater, exploiting theatricality while exposing the pretense. It is about a community of outsiders, queers, eccentrics. It is feminist because it encourages the imaginative potential in everyone and lesbian because it takes the presence of lesbian on stage as a given.' Their vaudevillian satirical gender-bending performances have received numerous awards, including a Jane Chamber award and four Village Voice OBIE awards. Their collection of scripts, Split Britches Feminist Performance/Lesbian Practice, edited by Sue Ellen Case, won the 1997 Lambda Literary Award for Drama. This video documents their show Patience and Sarah, an adaptation of the eponymous novel by Isabel Miller. The piece was adapted by Joyce Halliday and produced in the style of the Split Britches Company.

=520  \\$aFollowing one of Brecht's major premises, that theater should fulfill it's mission of creating critical consciousness while still entertaining, Ói Nóis adapts The exception and the rule to the streets. The story of the merchant and the porter who get lost in the desert is complemented by a chorus of seven performers, who sing the events using Afro-Brazilian rhythms, and a body of eleven performers that personifies the geography, the animals, and the feelings of the story.

In conjunction with visual artist Antonio Martorell, she created the concept of 'Teatreros Ambulantes' (Itinerant Performers, 1987-1990), resulting in twelve productions. 'Gente o Agente' is one of these projects. Directed by Puerto Rican experimental dance choreographer Viveca Vázquez, the piece is an exploration of the possible performance interactions with the 'Laberinto Eslabonado,' an environmental sculpture created by Martorell at the University of Puerto Rico, Cayey Campus. With the labyrinth as creative provocation, the performers explore expressive relationships between bodies, everyday objects, text and space. This piece is an example of the collaboration between Márquez, Martorell, the Teatreros Ambulantes, and local and international guest artists.

Created by Márquez in collaboration with Antonio Martorell (who also created the engravings onstage), the Teatreros de Cayey and the course Drama Activities II of University of Puerto Rico-Río Piedras Campus, this piece explores cultural preconceptions of womanhood. Myths, taboos, and advertisement slogans related to the first menstrual period and to the portrayal of women as objects of desire are juxtaposed in order to elicit a critical revision of the social codes concerning gender at play in Puerto Rican society.

This video documents the play '...qué c(s)iento volando?', a collective creation piece directed by Márquez in collaboration with Puerto Rican visual artist Antonio Martorell and their 'Teatreros Ambulantes' students from the University of Puerto Rico. Based on Jean-Claude Carrière's text 'The Conference of the Birds' (based, in turn, on a Persian myth), and translated unto Spanish by renowned Puerto Rican writer Ana Lydia Vega, the play revolves around the hardships and the search for happiness at play in the journey of Caribbean immigrants, from Africa to the West Indies to New York.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of Puerto Rican experimental dance performance ‘Tour de fuerza,’ choreographed by Viveca Vázquez and performed in New York City’s Dance Theater Workshop. Viveca Vázquez is a choreographer, dancer, and a professor of humanities and contemporary dance for actors at the University of Puerto Rico. She presented her first work with Pisotón, the first experimental dance group of Puerto Rico and, shortly after, Taller de Otra Cosa, of which she became the first director. Through the company she presented her choreographic work and produced events such as ‘Rompeforma’ a key festival in the development of the experimental dance and performance scene in Puerto Rico, which was co-produced with Puerto Rican choreographer based in the U.S. Merian Soto. Since 1984 she has produced and performed experimental dance works in the United States, Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina, among a great number of other places. As a teacher she has developed a pedagogical model based on body conscience and improvisation. ‘Tour de fuerza’ was a project conceived and directed by the end of the 1980s by Dance Theater Workshop’s executive director David White. The project included works by choreographers, filmmakers, perfomers, visual artists, etc. This video presents Viveca Vázquez’ participation in the project, which includes three pieces: The first one, ‘Mascando inglés’ (Chewing English), is an experimental dance choreography that works with the body in the context of the Puerto Rico-U.S. migration and the linguistic displacement that this migration generates. The performers’ bodies oscillate between orientation and disorientation, rhythmic movements and dislocation, sound and silence. These bodies are both linguistically and physically displaced. However, ‘Mascando inglés’ explores the ways in which the language of the body could entail other forms of communication.
=520  \\$aThe second piece, ‘Entendido’ (Under-stood), offers a choreography that intends to be synchronized; however, the most important part of this movement is each individual body and its particularities, given that dialogue implies assuming differences. The political content is highlighted by the presence of Puerto Rican and American flags - a symbol that positions the body between balance and unbalance, and a power that forces a disciplined body to obey several rules at the same time, but also impulses that body to subvert them. The third piece, ‘Las fumadoras’ (The Smokers), presents feminine bodies and their relationship between themselves and with various objects. The piece offers a sensation of intimacy and sharing, but also disappearance, silence, and darkness. By the minute the bodies are hardly visible, and only their movements reaffirm that they are a live presence. This physicality is finally accompanied by singing voices, which gives a glimpse of a possible sisterhood and freedom.

=520  \\$aTheater piece on political violence and displaced people in Colombia. Four women from all walks of life (a peasant, a bourgeoise, an actress, a security guard) meet at a bus station, fleeing from the war for diverse reasons. Created collaboratively (at a time when both La Máscara members and theater director Patricia Ariza migrated, fleeing from political persecution), the piece blends personal stories, fictional characters, and texts by Eduardo Galeano, Rigoberta Menchú and Patricia Ariza, in order to portray how the violence populating the regions of past and present passes on tormented memories, throwing the characters unto a place of encounters and departures, a place where dialogue is implausible, impossible, amongst torn and fragmented personal and collective histories. Haunted by their inner ghosts, the characters confront an adverse world in which they recognize, reinvent, and forget themselves. Teatro La Máscara is the oldest - and one of the only - feminist, all-women's theater in Colombia. Founded in 1972 in Cali, La Máscara was a political theater initially comprised of male as well as female actors; by the early 1980s, when only the women stayed and wanted to continue the theatrical trajectory of the group, Lucy Bolaños decided to make La Máscara a women's ensemble fully dedicated to a feminine dramaturgy on gender issues. Committed to feminism and social change, they have stayed true to this mission, despite the many social and economic pressures they've had to endure in an environment plagued by violence and machismo, which constantly seeks to 'invisibilize' their work. Because of their fruitful stubbornness, La Máscara is not only creating and staging plays, but also working with marginalized communities, actively participating in political protests and demonstrations, and being involved in the organization of theater festivals. Through their work, they keep re-thinking women's role in the construction of a peaceful Colombia.

=520  \\$aPlay based on the short story 'El guardagujas', by Mexican writer Juan José Arreola. The action is set in a train station where trains either never show up or pass by without stopping, leaving different characters - and their families - stranded. When the train does pass, some of the passengers disappear. This sparks endless discussions on the calamitous situation of train companies in the country (which reflects, and stands for, the calamitous situation of the country itself). Chaos, uncertainty and fear grow larger, just as in Colombian society in the '80s (it was the time of the 'Guerra Sucia', the 'dirty' civil war that involved the state, guerrillas and paramilitary forces). Nobody knows which station they are in. There are no signs. Where are they? What is their destination? Teatro Experimental de Cali (TEC) is a collective of artists committed to the exploration and creation of new languages for Latin American theater. Founded in Colombia in 1955 by Enrique Buenaventura and a group of students at the Instituto Departamental de Bellas Artes, TEC has had a long and fruitful trajectory; their artistic and theoretical work has revolutionized the way that theater is conceived and practiced in Latin America. A key contribution to the field is their method of 'creación colectiva' ('collective creation'), in which all the participants of the play - including the audience - become involved with the dramatic text and its staging. In spite of this stress on collective work, TEC had in Enrique Buenaventura its main poet and playwright, who developed most of TEC's texts and directed the majority of their plays. While TEC's works address various historical and social issues, artistic quality is not sacrificed for the sake of political radicalism. TEC has thus created a theater that is politically and culturally engaged, poetic and innovative without losing its popular appeal.

=520  \\$aFounded in 1965 by Luis Valdez, El Teatro Campesino was initially the cultural wing of the United Farm Workers union in California's central valley. With a pointed political mission, ETC performed their actos in the fields, agitprop improvisations communicated eloquently with the workers, who could neither read nor write, but recognized themselves and their values in the actos. By 1970 ETC had gained an international reputation, with major contributions to Chicano culture in the U.S. and to the development and expansion of the boundaries of theater everywhere. Theirs is a popular theater rooted in the American streets, early California history, Mayan/Aztec mythology and Mexican folklore and spiritualism, all geared toward expression of social, political and cultural perceptions. Valdez believes in a total theaterone where an elevation of sensation is achieved through a trinity of music, dance and drama to stimulate a New American Audience, a celebration of cultural diversity. This is a documentary of ETCs The Passion Play. Opening with a narration by Luis Valdez about the piece and a brief history of ETC, the documentary shows a fragment of the performance, which focuses on the Via Crucis (the Way of the Cross) as the condemned Messiah makes his way to his Crucifixion. The text is adapted from the New Testament, with a narrator serving to connect the traditional Stations of the Cross. Staged in the historic town plaza, fronting the old Mission of San Juan Bautista (founded in 1797), this open air spectacle allowed the audience to follow the various scenes both as observers and participants, as the action moved from place to place around the public square. Alternate performances were offered in English and in Spanish.

=520  \\$aThe Colectivo de Acciones de Arte (CADA) is a Chilean activist group of artists (artists Lotty Rosenfeld and Juan Castillo, sociologist Fernando Balcells, poet Raúl Zurita and novelist Diamela Eltit) who used performance to challenge the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile. One of the most important contributors to the ‘Escena Avanzada’, CADA incorporated strategies of theatricality and performance as an essential element to all its ‘art actions’, while questioning the practices and institutions of all politics and conceiving art as a necessary social practice that eradicated the traditional distance between the artist and the spectator. Committed to the foundation of an open and spontaneous practice of spectatorship, their ‘interventions in everyday life’ intended to interrupt and alter the normalized routines of the daily urban life of the citizen, by means of a semiotic subversion that decontextualized and semantically restructured urban behaviors, locations and signs.
=520  \\$aOn the 10th year of Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship in Chile, CADA proposed the slogan 'NO +' (NO more). This was meant as an open text to be completed by the citizens, according to their specific social demands (No more ...). CADA invited Chilean artists from different fields to spread this message on walls all over Santiago. Wall tagging was the first form of NO+, but the slogan was soon used by different collectives all over the country as a massive public symbol of political resistance and non-conformity.
=520  \\$aThis documentary shows the application of the slogan NO + by the women's movement in Chile; the video portrays the women's movement as an active participant in joint efforts of civic resistance against the dictatorship.

=520  \\$aThe play starts with a traveler (Aldo Tarazona), who arrives at the stage and affirms he has reached the place where he will stay from then on. But when he decides to claim this piece of land his own, a new character shows up and they start arguing. When still more characters appear, Aldo realizes he was not the first one to arrive at this place. They start judging the newcomer and going through his belongings. Then they welcome him and he stays with the inhabitants of the place. Aldo gets involved with one of them, Alicia; five years go by and they have a child. A priest shows up and tries to marry them. Alicia becomes a circus artist. With the baby on her back, Alicia climbs up to the heights of the circus tent. The play ends with the newcomer begging her to come down. After all these experiences, Aldo learns that reality is more complex than he had thought, that sometimes reason, logic and the senses are not completely trustworthy. La Candelaria was founded in 1966 by a group of independent artists and intellectuals who came from experimental theater and the broader Colombian cultural movement. Directed by Santiago García, La Candelaria (www.teatrolacandelaria.org.co) is one of Colombian theater's most innovative agents, modernizing national drama while addressing popular audiences. By means of an ongoing exploration of national folklore, situations and characters, they have created some of Colombia's most compelling plays, some of them through the method of 'creación colectiva' (collective creation), addressing the acute social and political problems of their society. At the same time, they fostered the creation of Corporación Colombiana del Teatro and have developed a number of theoretical works that reflect upon dramatic creation, its methods and languages. Still nowadays, La Candelaria is committed to repertoire, experimentation, and discussion as fundamental elements to artistic creation.

=520  \\$aA 1989 concert by Annie Humphrey (Ojibwe) at the American Indian Community House in New York City. Annie Humphrey (www.anniehumphrey.com) was born and raised on an Ojibwe Indian reservation in Northern Minnesota. Her father taught her how to play the guitar when she was in the first grade; two years later she was playing piano (she taught herself) and composing her first songs. Humphrey's first national exposure came on the album The Whispering Tree, a collaborative recording of poetry and music by various artists featuring Humphrey. In 2001, Humphrey received The Native American Music Awards Female Artist of the Year Award, for her first solo album, The Heron Smiled which was also voted Best Folk recording of the year. Edge of America, also on Makoché, was released in the fall of 2003. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city. AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto neighborhood serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area. The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICHs Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICHs visual and performing arts department programs. Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badgers Corner.

=520  \\$aRosa Luisa Márquez (www.marquezmartorell.org) is a Puerto Rican theater artist and pedagogue; she specializes in contemporary theater. Rosa Luisa started her teaching career at the theater department of the University of Puerto Rico in 1978. She developed the current curriculum of Drama Activities, which she teaches in her workshops at schools, prisons, rehab centers, women's shelters and community centers. Her directing projects include 'Romeo(s) y Julieta(s),' 'Historias para ser Contadas,' 'La Leyenda del Cemí,' 'Procesión,' 'Waiting for Godot,' 'Jardín de Pulpos,' 'Absurdos en Soledad,' 'El León y la Joya,' among others. Published books include 'Brincos y saltos: el juego como disciplina teatral' and 'Historias para ser contadas, montaje de Rosa Luisa Márquez.' She is a member of the board of directors and pedagogical team for the EITALC's International School of Latin American and Caribbean Theater. Ongoing artistic collaborators include Gilda Navarra and Antonio Martorell (Puerto Rico), Grupo Malayerba (Ecuador), Grupo Yuyachkani (Peru), and directors Peter Shumann (Bread & Puppet Theater, U.S.A.) and Augusto Boal (Theater of the Oppressed, Brazil). In conjunction with visual artist Antonio Martorell, she created the concept of 'Teatreros Ambulantes' (Itinerant Performers, 1987-1990), resulting in twelve productions. 'La Pasión y Muerte de Adolfina Villanueva' is one of these projects. A co-production of Peter Schumann's Bread & Puppet Theater and the Teatreros Ambulantes, it tells the story of Adolfina Villanueva, a woman who was assassinated by the police in the Afro-Puerto Rican town of Loíza while defending her home and family during a forced eviction operative on February 6th, 1980. The piece brings to the forefront issues of human rights and current tensions between impoverished communities and developers of 'exclusive' building projects, all issues affecting the Puerto Rican society as a whole: as the piece states, 'we are all on the same boat.'

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of Circus Amok's first show, 'The Ozone Show', performed in 1989 at renowned NYC performance venue P.S. 122. The piece revolves around the topic of environmental pollution and its subsequent depletion effect on the ozone layer, along with its manifold ecological repercussions. A 'lack of protection' is exposed through the denunciation of related environmental issues like the greenhouse effect, worldwide epidemics, illegal toxic wasted dumping, ineffective governmental policy, the effect of pollution on endangered species, etc., all interwoven in a joyful extravaganza of acrobatic artistry, satiric skill, and good old-fashioned circus fun. Circus Amok (www.circusamok.org) is a New York City based circus-theater company whose mission is to provide free public art addressing contemporary issues of social justice to the people of New York City. Directed and founded by Jennifer Miller, the group has been together since 1989 bringing its funny, queer, caustic and sexy, political one-ring spectacles to diverse neighborhoods throughout the city. Over the years the traditional circus skills - tight rope walking, juggling, acrobatics, stilt walking, clowning - have been combined with experimental dance, lifesize puppetry, music old and new, and gender-bending performance art and improvisational techniques, creating new meanings for circus while continuing to entertain the crowds of all ages throughout the city streets, gardens, parks, and playgrounds, inviting the audience to join them in envisioning a more empowered life of community interaction while enjoying a queer celebratory spectacle.

=520  \\$a'Native American Visions,' a concert of contemporary, traditional and jazz music featuring Jim Pepper, Arto Tuncboyachi and the a cappella group Pura Fe, was part the 1989 'Celebrate Brooklyn' festival, held at the Prospect Park Bandshell. The show was opened with traditional American Indian drumming and singing and also featured dancer, Raoul Trujillo's contemporary dance solo, 'The Shaman's Journey'. Saxophonist Jim Pepper (b. 1941 - d. 1992) a Creek and Kaw Indian was an innovative jazz musician who made his mark in the United States and in Europe. His unique style fused Native American Church music and powwow music with the experimental jazz. His best know work, 'Pepper's Pow Wow,' was released in 1971. Pepper was a big influence on Muscogee poet Joy Harjo, and collaborated with the Native women's a cappella group, Ulali. He was inducted into the Native American Music Awards Hall of Fame posthumously after his tragic death following his battle with lymphoid cancer. 
=520  \\$aPepper is remembered for his contribution to both the Jazz scene and the Native music scene, and for expanding the perceptions and expectations of both genres. Raoul Trujillo (Apache/Ute) is an actor, dancer, and former soloist with the Nikolais Dance Theatre and the original choreographer and co-director for the American Indian Dance Theatre. He is the host for a series of dancing programs and received an Emmy Nomination for Best Performer as the Host/Narrator for the highly acclaimed New York Public Television series, 'Dancing.' Pura Fe, (Tuscarora), Soni Moreno (Apache/Mayan) and Jennifer Kreisberg (Tuscarora) are now known as and the sole members of the a cappella group Ulali (formally Pura Fe). Ulali blends a variety of traditional and contemporary indigenous music of the Americas, incorporating political, social and personal issues that affect all of humanity.   
=520  \\$aBy fusing outside influences with Native words and music, Ulali challenges notions of how 'traditional' words and concepts are applicable in the modern world. The group can be heard on dozens of albums, documentaries and movies. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city. AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto 'neighborhood' serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of 'Yourcenar, o Cada Quien su Marguerite,' a 'sacred divertimento' based on French writer Marguerite Yourcenar's text 'Qui n'a pas son Minotaure', adapted and directed by Mexican theater and performance artist Jesusa Rodríguez. Inspired by the Greek myth of Theseus, Ariadne and the Minotaur, the play poses a philosophical reflection on the desires, repressions, dreams and sufferings of contemporary men and women. The triangle Ariadne-Theseus-Phaedra (performed by Paloma Woolrich, Juan Ibarra and Claudia Lobo respectively), brings to the forefront dramatic conflicts rooted in a series of dualities: sensual/spiritual, constructive/destructive, idealist/pragmatic, male/female, to attack/to wait. The performance, full of poetic images, choreographic gestures, and mythic symbolism, renders the Minotaur a metaphor of these conflicts (the 'inner monsters' of humanity): each one of us, contemporary people, confronts our own inner Minotaur. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodréguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a 'chameleon,' Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her 'espectáculos' (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and 'carpa,' to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguez's energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: 'I am going to die with that woman.' Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. In this off-off space, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas, Jesusa y Liliana have produced hundreds of shows since the 1980s.

=520  \\$aIn this video, Ana Correa (one of the founding and still active members of Peruvian theater ensemble Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani) demonstrates her acting technique to a group of students, complemented with further commentary by Yuyachkani's artistic director Miguel Rubio. Correa believes that the body is an actor's instrument; in this pedagogical demonstration she focuses on her body work and her work with objects in the development of a character. Among the diverse elements of body work, Correa shows: the importance of moving the body through space in different ways and at different speeds; the importance of feeling your weight in the space; and how to make musical 'phrases' with your body, and how to play with the timing of the phrase and manipulate it. The demonstration also includes an example of how the actress incorporates Tai-chi into her character development Tai chi being an important methodology for exploring and developing bodily expressivity for Yuyachkani. The lecture also includes mask work, as Ana shows how the mask takes on its own identity, how the masked character moves, and how it responds to various objects. Correa also discusses the balance between text work and body work. One of the elements of body work she demonstrates is dance, in particular the use of tap dance to learn how to play with timing. Ms. Correa goes over the creation of one of her characters, 'Po Po' the clown. Part of her methodology for creating this character included playing with musical instruments (in the case of 'Po Po', an accordion), not only as instruments per se but also as performing objects; special attention is paid to the exploration of how to express emotions with and through them. Peru's most important theater collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani (www.yuyachkani.org) has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. 'Yuyachkani' is a Quechua word that means 'I am thinking, I am remembering'; under this name, the theater group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru. The group is comprised of seven actors (Augusto Casafranca, Amiel Cayo, Ana Correa, Débora Correa, Rebeca Ralli, Teresa Ralli, and Julián Vargas), a technical designer (Fidel Melquíades), and an artistic director (Miguel Rubio), who have made a commitment to collective creation as a mode of theatrical production and to group theater as a life style. Their work has been among the most important in Latin America's so called 'New Popular Theater,' with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy. Yuyachkani won Peru's National Human Rights Award in 2000. Known for its creative embrace of both indigenous performance forms as well as cosmopolitan theatrical forms, Yuyachkani offers insight into Peruvian and Latin American theater, and to broader issues of postcolonial social aesthetics.

=520  \\$aThis is a video documentation of an ‘acción’ performed in a public square in La Paz, Bolivia. Using a blood-colored liquid and the presence of young women, Mujeres Creando invites the passers-by to reflect upon the lives lost in the constant struggle for political power, and reminds them that women are one of the main victims of a political system that allows institutional gendered violence. Questioning the functionality of the President as representative of Bolivian people, this acción suggests that repression is not exclusive of dictatorships, and that democracy also exerts oppression through unequal gender politics. The intervention of the police in order to stop the acción illustrates how Mujeres Creando’s work brings together performance and activism.
=520  \\$aMujeres Creando is a feminist anarchist movement created in 1990 in La Paz, Bolivia. It is comprised of women of different cultural, social, and ethnic origins, and explores creativity as an instrument of resistance and social participation. The three women who founded this communitarian proposal (Maria Galindo, Julieta Paredes, and Monica Mendoza) worked together to recover the public space that the patriarchal system appropriated. In this sense, the group does not only struggle for women’s rights or issues that affect women, but also against other problems that affect society. The ways of expression of Mujeres Creando are graffiti, creativity, ongoing public debates, and acciones, along with a constant presence in the streets to reclaim a voice and participation in the public sphere. Since its beginnings, the group has been part of international gatherings, dialoguing with different feminist tendencies and thus being able to build its ideological identity within the autonomous feminism, in contrast and in connection with global struggles. In April 2001, due to ethical and political disagreements, there was a division in the group, which brought the necessity to differentiate names. In spite of this divergence, Maria Galindo continues working with Mujeres Creando in Bolivia.

Mujeres Creando’s proposal considers that ‘the street is the space where we make sense, where be become full of meaning;’ thus, the streets are the most important stage to perform political gestures and to enact political actions. Through the simple but powerful act of setting a dining table in the middle of the streets, Mujeres Creando bring together the private and the public, and reconfigure the structures of power that constrain people’s freedom. The acción of sharing food with the passers-by not only addresses the fact that we all are equals and part of the same society, but also invites to remember that sharing communal activities is an act of love.

Mujeres Creando filled the building’s hall with pieces of paper, to demand an actual and functional justice for all the cases of rape and murders against women. Considering that the notion of ‘justice’ seems to be reduced to meaningless paperwork that does not solve anything, Mujeres Creando claim that ‘justice’ in Bolivia is bought by privileges of class and race, and that there is no justice for the dispossessed. Through the acción of disrupting the building’s routine, and through the use of voices and singing, Mujeres Creando bring the voices of women who have not received justice.

=520  \\$aThis is a video documentation of an ‘acción’ performed at the entrance of a mall in La Paz, Bolivia. When women dressed in traditional indigenous Aymara clothing approach to white women to offer them Mujeres Creando’s pink ribbons, some of those women do not know how to react – some of them think that the indigenous women are selling something, or begging, and some of them ignore their indigenous peers. Collecting opinions of the mall’s female costumers, it is clear that some of them even question the fact that indigenous women can be at the door of the mall, ‘invading their space,’ where they should not be allowed. On the other side, the indigenous women who participate in the acción mention that they sensed that some women felt repulsion against them. With this acción, Mujeres Creando exposed the racism that exists between women of the same country. This exposure of racism against indigenous people brings to the fore a question about visibility, and what people choose to see. By going to the mall in their indigenous clothes, or ‘chola clothes,’ Mujeres Creando highlights the fact that racism is also embodied in a specific way of dressing, and that ‘dressing like a chola’ is an act of political transvestism, a gesture that demands us to see that which has been invisibilized.

Two women walk carrying a mirror and Barbie dolls, inviting women to question the beauty patterns imposed by a patriarchal and neo-colonial society. At the public square, a group of women struggle with the mirrors, the Barbie dolls, and colored ribbons that tie and constrain them. Finally, they free themselves from the ribbons and the mirrors. With this acción, Mujeres Creando criticize the beauty patterns imposed upon women, and the social expectations that make women fight against women; they also question the racism embedded in Bolivian society, where indigenous women don’t recognize themselves in the white skin and blond hair of the ‘model’ of feminine beauty.

=520  \\$aThis is a video documentation of two ‘acciones’ performed in-between the realms of the private and the public in La Paz, Bolivia. In the first part, an indigenous woman speaks while she undoes her braids and brushes her hair. She speaks about her sexuality, and claims that she is ‘una chola diferente, una chola libre’ (‘a different chola, a free chola’). In the second part, Julieta Paredes and María Galindo, two of the founding members of Mujeres Creando, draw a red heart at the center of the public square, and after offering flowers to the passers-by, they set a bed in the middle of the painted heart, lay down together, hold hands, and kiss each other. With these acciones, Mujeres Creando point out how gender and body politics constrain even the more intimate relationships, and how anti-lesbianism is strongly rooted in a patriarchal society. Bringing lesbian love to a public space and talking about sexuality aloud are vehement political gestures of rebellion and resistance.

It is comprised of women of different cultural, social, and ethnic origins, and explores creativity as an instrument of resistance and social participation. The three women who founded this communitarian proposal (Maria Galindo, Julieta Paredes, and Monica Mendoza) worked together to recover the public space that the patriarchal system appropriated. In this sense, the group does not only struggle for women’s rights or issues that affect women, but also against other problems that affect society. The ways of expression of Mujeres Creando are graffiti, creativity, ongoing public debates, and acciones, along with a constant presence in the streets to reclaim a voice and participation in the public sphere. Since its beginnings, the group has been part of international gatherings, dialoguing with different feminist tendencies and thus being able to build its ideological identity within the autonomous feminism, in contrast and in connection with global struggles. In April 2001, due to ethical and political disagreements, there was a division in the group, which brought the necessity to differentiate names. In spite of this divergence, Maria Galindo continues working with Mujeres Creando in Bolivia.

In the first part, a young woman’s speech ironically reinstates what is socially expected from women, at the same time that it suggests the possibility of building a non-profit organization lead by local women. In the second part, Mujeres Creando propose a strong criticism against international NGOs, questioning the paternalism of organizations lead by people who see indigenous communities as exotic. They also critique some NGOs’ corruption with regards international donations, and point out the race and gender issues involved in cultural imperialism.

Working with the universally consumed product from the Andes, a group of women peel potatoes, while they talk about their desire for equal opportunity of work for women and men, and better conditions for jobs that could also feed their dreams and hopes. In this acción, Mujeres Creando worked in collaboration with a group of men, who start washing clothes and peeling potatoes side by side with women. Finally, all together create the word ‘felicidad’ (‘happiness’) with potatoes painted in red, ending the acción with a product of a collaborative effort.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of a fragment of Mapa Teatro's production 'De Mortibus, Réquiem para Beckett.' Between 1988 and 1990, Heidi and Rolf Abderhalden embarked on an in-depth research process on the literary works of Samuel Beckett. Three months before his death, Beckett gave his approval for this production, which premiered in Bogotá in 1990 to critical acclaim. In 'De Mortibus,' the walls are painted white, actors are dressed in gray and nobody speaks, as if it were a world of paralysis. Actors work in almost total silence, forming sculptures that embody emotional states such as sadness, rage, indifference, and uncertainty. Mapa Teatro's production assigns each gesture, object, color, position, sound, and word a specific intention: to communicate and produce sensations, to invite a reaction, and to provoke an experience by which the limits of communication are (re)established.
=520  \\$aOne of the foremost artistic companies in Colombia, Mapa Teatro (www.mapateatro.org) has been producing theater, performance and art installation projects since 1984. Founders and directors, Rolf and Heidi Abderhalden have created a wide ranging repertoire of theater, opera, mixed-media performance, and site-specific installation. Their work proposes richly textured visual metaphors in which they consider often complex psychological, social and political relationships. Committed to experimentation, and less interested in the actor as an 'agent of fiction,' they describe their project as 'a laboratory of social imagination,' that offers a space for presenting community issues and human concerns in media and performance. This combination of real-life situations and sites along with highly stylized aesthetic staging produces a tension between real action and (re)presentation. Mapa Teatro draws from live events captured on video such as the demolition of a neighborhood in Bogotá, ritual practice, and texts that explore the relationship of postmodern subjects, myth and metaphor. Mapa Teatro has performed by commissions, festivals and collaborative projects world-wide.

=520  \\$aTwo old drunk, crazy witches - Verdad (Truth) and Mentira (Lie) - are condemned to wander around the world. They journey through a universe of myths and legends as ancient and contemporary as humanity. They visit the deserted and arid Village of the Hungry, the colorful Diulas Plane, the dense night of Bereber bandits, and the large desert of the Maasai. The whole trip works as an educating experience. Eventually, Truth and Lie go back to the place they left; thanks to their travel experiences, they have grown up and changed. The play is based on the anthologies of African myths and tales gathered by Leo Frobenius and Blaise Cendrars: 'The Black Decameron' and 'Black Anthology'. Black Africans constitute one of the ethnic groups of Colombia and TEC has always tried to rescue, redeem and celebrate the diverse roots of Colombian national identity. Teatro Experimental de Cali (TEC) is a collective of artists committed to the exploration and creation of new languages for Latin American theater. Founded in Colombia in 1955 by Enrique Buenaventura and a group of students at the Instituto Departamental de Bellas Artes, TEC has had a long and fruitful trajectory; their artistic and theoretical work has revolutionized the way that theater is conceived and practiced in Latin America. A key contribution to the field is their method of 'creación colectiva' ('collective creation'), in which all the participants of the play - including the audience - become involved with the dramatic text and its staging. In spite of this stress on collective work, TEC had in Enrique Buenaventura its main poet and playwright, who developed most of TEC's texts and directed the majority of their plays. While TEC's works address various historical and social issues, artistic quality is not sacrificed for the sake of political radicalism. TEC has thus created a theater that is politically and culturally engaged, poetic and innovative without losing its popular appeal.

=520  \\$a'Voces de Acero' is a collective creation incorporating movement, theater, poetry and music about the will to survive in a world of uniform color, uniform smell and uniform lighting. When the play was created (1990) there were more than 150 political activists connected to Left-wing movements, serving sentences in federal prisons throughout the United States. Alejandrina Torres, a Puerto Rican independence activist accused of seditious conspiracy, tried and sentenced to 35 years, was one of the 4 women designated to serve time in the Lexington Control Unit - a 100 foot long block with 16 cells, completely self-contained and classified as a High Security Unit (HSU). The Lexington HSU signified the emergence of a new strategy in detention aimed at political transformation via isolation, extensive surveillance, and sensory deprivation. The characters in the play are inspired by Torres and the other 21 Puerto Rican political prisoners in U.S. jails under similar circumstances. All characters are fictitious. The focus of the production is allegorical and not didactic. The design is stark and evocative of the isolation and timelessness imperative in the HSU. The work was the result of an extensive process of improvisation and experimentation. Founded in 1979 and based in The Bronx, New York City, Pregones Theater (http://www.pregones.org) has performed in more than 400 cities and 13 countries. The company enjoys citywide recognition for their lasting contributions to the performing arts field and are recipients of numerous distinctions including current Leading National Ensemble Theatre Designation from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Primary Cultural Institution Designation from the New York State Council on the Arts, the New York State Governor's Arts Award, the Culture & Humanities Award from the Center for Puerto Rican Studies, numerous artist and production awards, as well as invitations to appear at international festivals and events. Over the years Pregones has developed a style that combines theater, music and movement, oral and written traditions, and a signature urban sensibility. The ensemble draws from popular Puerto Rican artistic expressions and literature to create and stage its work. Today, Pregones has grown to be one of the leading Puerto Rican/Latino theater theaters in the United States. From migrations to indigenous mythologies to subway stories, the company's repertoire covers a growing sample of Latino experiences and identities.

=520  \\$a'The Embrace' deals, in a very different way, with the effects produced by AIDS in the Latino community and focuses on the importance of taking active participation in the presented scenes and suggesting changes through action. The production grew out of Pregones' work with Brazilian Augusto Boal, particularly as an adaptation of his Forum Theater techniques. The production toured over 100 community sites in East Harlem & The Bronx in New York, and in New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts. The presentations were designed to promote direct audience participation in order to heighten awareness and develop sensitivity to persons with AIDS and their families. A health counselor always traveled with the production to answer audience questions and to offer information on HIV transmission and adoption of AIDS risk-reduction behavior. Founded in 1979 and based in The Bronx, New York City, Pregones Theater (http://www.pregones.org) has performed in more than 400 cities and 13 countries. The company enjoys citywide recognition for their lasting contributions to the performing arts field and are recipients of numerous distinctions including current Leading National Ensemble Theatre Designation from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Primary Cultural Institution Designation from the New York State Council on the Arts, the New York State Governor's Arts Award, the Culture & Humanities Award from the Center for Puerto Rican Studies, numerous artist and production awards, as well as invitations to appear at international festivals and events. Over the years Pregones has developed a style that combines theater, music and movement, oral and written traditions, and a signature urban sensibility. The ensemble draws from popular Puerto Rican artistic expressions and literature to create and stage its work. Today, Pregones has grown to be one of the leading Puerto Rican/Latino theater theaters in the United States. From migrations to indigenous mythologies to subway stories, the company's repertoire covers a growing sample of Latino experiences and identities.

=520  \\$a'Skin, Stone, Positive', created by Off the Beaten Path, presents historical and contemporary Native American creation and survival tales. The piece was inspired by Native peoples attempts to get their ancestor's remains 'repatriated' from Institutional collections located throughout the country and reports on the close to 25,000 human remains that were studied and stored in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. The Native American Graves and Protection Act, which protects existing burial grounds and provides for the repatriation of remains and funerary objects from collections in museums and universities to their proper cultural homes was not signed into law until 1990. Off the Beaten Path was an ensemble of American Indian actors that was formed in 1984 to promote Native American Theater. They produced both traditional and contemporary works by Native American playwrights. The Theater troupe disbanded in the 1990's so the artists could pursue individual projects. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city. AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto 'neighborhood' serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area. The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICH's Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980's, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICHs visual and performing arts department programs. Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badger's Corner.

=520  \\$aPerformed at renowned NYC performance venue P.S. 122, 'Spies R Us' is Circus Amok's second show. Through a carnivalesque 'film noir' aesthetic, the piece poses a satiric critique of US foreign (and homeland security) policy, in a joyful extravaganza of acrobatic artistry, satiric skill, and good old-fashioned circus fun. The overarching theme of espionage points to conflicting relationships between 'special agents' of government agencies like the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and issues of distortion and disinformation, imperialism, bigotry, violence, paranoia and political impunity. The play is an open call to be informed of current events and to defend and empower civic activism in the face of governmental conflictive agendas. Circus Amok (www.circusamok.org) is a New York City based circus-theater company whose mission is to provide free public art addressing contemporary issues of social justice to the people of New York City. Directed and founded by Jennifer Miller, the group has been together since 1989 bringing its funny, queer, caustic and sexy, political one-ring spectacles to diverse neighborhoods throughout the city. Over the years the traditional circus skills - tight rope walking, juggling, acrobatics, stilt walking, clowning - have been combined with experimental dance, lifesize puppetry, music old and new, and gender-bending performance art and improvisational techniques, creating new meanings for circus while continuing to entertain the crowds of all ages throughout the city streets, gardens, parks, and playgrounds, inviting the audience to join them in envisioning a more empowered life of community interaction while enjoying a queer celebratory spectacle.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of Grupo Cultural Yuyachkanis theater piece Adiós Ayacucho (Farewell Ayacucho), adapted by Miguel Rubio Zapata from the eponymous tale by Peruvian writer Julio Ortega and performed by Augusto Casafranca with music by Ana Correa. Adiós Ayacucho tells the story of Alfonso Cánepa, a farmworker leader from the Southern Peruvian Andes, disappeared and killed during the 1980s, who returns from the netherworld and begins a journey to Lima, the capital city, looking for his bones so that he could rest in peace. Cánepa befriends a Qolla (a comic Andean dancer), who lends him his body and his voice so that he could tell his story. The play is performed around a platform that supports pieces of clothing, according to the Andean custom that lays them in wake, eight days after the death of a relative, as a final farewell ritual. 
=520  \\$aDuring the years of political terror of Perus Dirty War this ritual has been transformed as the only way to bid farewell to the souls of the departed when their bodies have been disappeared by the military. Perus most important theatre collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani (www.yuyachkani.org) has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. Yuyachkani is a Quechua word that means I am thinking, I am remembering; under this name, the theatre group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru.   
=520  \\$aThe group is comprised of seven actors (Augusto Casafranca, Amiel Cayo, Ana Correa, Débora Correa, Rebeca Ralli, Teresa Ralli, and Julián Vargas), a technical designer (Fidel Melquíades), and an artistic director (Miguel Rubio), who have made a commitment to collective creation as a mode of theatrical production and to group theater as a life style. Their work has been among the most important in Latin Americas so called New Popular Theater, with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy. Yuyachkani won Perus National Human Rights Award in 2000. Known for its creative embrace of both indigenous performance forms as well as cosmopolitan theatrical forms, Yuyachkani offers insight into Peruvian and Latin American theatre, and to broader issues of postcolonial social aesthetics.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of theater piece No Me Toquen Ese Vals (Don't Play That Waltz for Me), created collectively by performers Rebeca Ralli and Julián Vargas, and director Miguel Rubio of Peruvian Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani. In this play, two dead nightclub performers return to their favorite club in Lima, which has become a city of unrelieved destruction. The performers, characters Abelardo and Amanda, try to recapture their act, their identities, their audience and a grip on life. Rising from the mists of death, or perhaps from hell, the performers--he amid racks of drums and cymbals and she in a wheelchair--try to recover speech, coordination, a sense of each other, passion, even sex, but they never quite connect. Perus most important theatre collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani (www.yuyachkani.org) has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation.

=511  1\$aEl Teatro Campesino.
=520  \\$aFounded in 1965 by Luis Valdez, El Teatro Campesino was initially the cultural wing of the United Farm Workers union in California's central valley. With a pointed political mission, ETC performed their actos in the fields, agitprop improvisations communicated eloquently with the workers, who could neither read nor write, but recognized themselves and their values in the actos. By 1970 ETC had gained an international reputation, with major contributions to Chicano culture in the U.S. and to the development and expansion of the boundaries of theater everywhere. Theirs is a popular theater rooted in the American streets, early California history, Mayan/Aztec mythology and Mexican folklore and spiritualism, all geared toward expression of social, political and cultural perceptions. Valdez believes in a total theaterone where an elevation of sensation is achieved through a trinity of music, dance and drama to stimulate a New American Audience, a celebration of cultural diversity. The Four Roads is a documentary celebrating El Teatro Campesinos 25th anniversary. A retrospective showcasing the groups broad spectrum of theater projects, it contains a rich array of archival footage and interviews. The documentary is organized by the Mayan myth of the Four Roadscentral to ETCs philosophy and aesthetichere presented as the four roads of creation: the Road of the Heart, the Road of the Body, the Road of the Mind, and the Road of the Soul. It is a fitting homage to the outstanding artistic contributions of El Teatro Campesino to Chicano culture and to popular theater around the world.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of experimental dance performance ‘Sui-(We),’ created and choreographed by Viveca Vázquez and Sally Silvers, and performed in New York City’s Performance Space 122. Viveca Vázquez is a choreographer, dancer, and a professor of humanities and contemporary dance for actors at the University of Puerto Rico. She presented her first work with Pisotón, the first experimental dance group of Puerto Rico and, shortly after, Taller de Otra Cosa, of which she became the first director. Through the company she presented her choreographic work and produced events such as ‘Rompeforma’ a key festival in the development of the experimental dance and performance scene in Puerto Rico, which was co-produced with Puerto Rican choreographer based in the U.S. Merian Soto. Since 1984 she has produced and performed experimental dance works in the United States, Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina, among a great number of other places. As a teacher she has developed a pedagogical model based on body conscience and improvisation. Sally Silvers is a New York-based choreographer who has performed nationally and internationally in South Korea, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Europe, the American Dance Festival, and many other locations. As an artistic director, Sally Silvers has an on-going fascination with the poetic as well as the social meanings of movement.
=520  \\$a‘Sui-(We)’ is a collaborative creation that places on stage two feminine bodies struggling with their own corporeality. The piece questions pre-conceptions of what a feminine body is and how it moves, and in doing this it offers a rethinking of gender identities. Both bodies are in contact but disconnected at the same time, functioning as support and impulse to each other; this dialogue and counterpoint is continuous, given that while a body expands, the other contracts. This game between connection and disconnection mirrors a dislocation between movement, sound, and silence. In this manner, the performance presents bodies-in-between, which reassure their existence and their political significance only through a shared corporeality and collaborative movement.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of Viveca Vázquez’ Puerto Rican experimental dance performance ‘Malajuste’ (Maladjustment). Viveca Vázquez is a choreographer, dancer, and a professor of humanities and contemporary dance for actors at the University of Puerto Rico. She presented her first work with Pisotón, the first experimental dance group of Puerto Rico and, shortly after, Taller de Otra Cosa, of which she became the first director. Through the company she presented her choreographic work and produced events such as ‘Rompeforma’ a key festival in the development of the experimental dance and performance scene in Puerto Rico, which was co-produced with Puerto Rican choreographer based in the U.S. Merian Soto. Since 1984 she has produced and performed experimental dance works in the United States, Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina, among a great number of other places. As a teacher she has developed a pedagogical model based on body conscience and improvisation.
=520  \\$a‘Malajuste’ is a Taller de Otra Cosa’s proposal, created as a collective collaboration with a group of young people to work on dance, and to develop a space of co-creation, exploration, and study. This performance includes four pieces: The first one, ‘Mast-urbana,’ plays with sexuality topics, and gender roles, in a society marked by taboo. The video insert explores topics such as sexuality, religion, masturbation, and guilt, and the relationship with the own body; the presence of this video also points out the role of visuality in our body self-perception. The second piece, ‘Mira y qué’ questions pre-concepts of what a masculine body might be, and subverts the relationship between the masculine and the feminine. The feminine ‘voice’ is also questioned through the resource of lip-synching. The third piece, ‘Nacedós’ contrasts quotidian movement vs. very oppressive sound. In this manner, the piece proposes one of the main concerns of this performance: how to ‘adjust’? How does the language of the body adjust to external inputs, like sound; and also to ‘constructed’ inputs, like gender roles, or visuality? Finally, the last piece, ‘Vieques no es un pescao’ is dedicated to Vieques Island and Puerto Rico, and their resistance against army tests by the US military. This island is referred as a zone of disaster; however, the question about which force is more harmful, the natural forces or the human forces -- with their political and economical greed -- remains open. With this last part, the idea of “adjustment” involves a political turn and a component of social concern that includes Puerto Rico in the reflection presented on stage.

=520  \\$aSince 1981, the Split Britches Company (founded by Lois Weaver, Peggy Shaw, and Deb Margolin, www.splitbritches.com) has written and performed in trio, duet, and solo, as well as collaborated and performed with other artists. They describe their work in this way: 'Our work is rooted in popular culture, but positioned against it. It relies on moments rather than plot, relationships rather than story. It depends on the surprise of transformation rather than the logic of psychological narrative. It straddles the line between performance and theater, exploiting theatricality while exposing the pretense. It is about a community of outsiders, queers, eccentrics. It is feminist because it encourages the imaginative potential in everyone and lesbian because it takes the presence of lesbian on stage as a given.' Their vaudevillian satirical gender-bending performances have received numerous awards, including a Jane Chamber award and four Village Voice OBIE awards. Their collection of scripts, Split Britches Feminist Performance/Lesbian Practice, edited by Sue Ellen Case, won the 1997 Lambda Literary Award for Drama. This video documents their show The Anniversary Waltz. A celebration of Lois and Peggys 10-year relationship, created 15 years before the debate on gay marriage, it is a commentary on the tendency to couple and a critique on the institution of marriage. At the same time it is a tribute to long term relationships sustained through creative work and an appropriation of the husband and wife team identities represented in vaudeville variety acts, comedy duos and musical duets.

=518  \\$aPerformed in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 1990.
=520  \\$aBased on Sophocles' play, this performance intertwines text fragments by Albert Camus, Anaïs Nin, Antonin Artaud, Bertolt Brecht, Dante Alighieri, Edgar Alan Poe, Ezra Pound, Fiodor Dostoievski, Friedrich Nietzsche, Heiner Müller, Hölderlin, Jean Anouilh, Jean Cocteau, Jean Paul Sartre, Julian Beck, Lao Tsé, and Mallarmé. Ói Nóis found in the Greek Tragedy of Sophocles a space to discuss the civil disobedience of the individual against the oppression of the State. The play is adapted into an environmental performance, beginning with the battle between Thebes and Argos in the courtyard of the Terreira, and progressing through the five different environments the audience crosses, including a desert covered in tons of sand. The adaptation does not follow the classical structure but is divided into a non-realistic sequence of 30 scenes, including a dialogue between a mother and a son who deserted war, an added scene that tells the story from the point of view of the people instead of that of nobility, which classical tragedy privileges. The performance lasts three hours and accomodates fifty spectators, who are invited both to watch and to participate in scenes such as the 'Bacchanal,' featuring the cutting off and ritual burial of a giant phallus that Creonte wears by a Maenad. Text fragments from Camus, Artaud, Brecht, Nietzsche, Heiner Müller, Julian Beck, and several other authors, are intertwined into the narrative with the purpose of opening up the Greek story into other political situations.
=520  \\$aBased in Porto Alegre, The Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz was born in 1978 out of a desire for a radical renovation of the language of theatre. During the several years of their existence, they have created a personal aesthetics founded upon the authorial work of the actor, both on the stage and on the streets. Their venue, the Terreira da Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, works as a community theatre school, offering several free workshops open to the public. Their tribal organization is based on the principle of collective work, both in the creative process and in the maintenance of the space. For Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, theater is an instrument for both revealing and analyzing reality, and it's function is social - to contribute to the collective knowledge and to the improvement of the quality of life of the people. In a world marked by exclusion, marginalization, homogenization, by dehumanizing and barbaric efforts, they see it as their moral imperative to denounce injustice, sold opinions, authoritarianism, mediocrity and the erasing of memory. Ói Nóis sees theatre as an art of resistance, in the service of arts and politics, an art that does not fit the market patterns for ethics and aesthetics. Instead, they see theater as a way of life and as a vehicle for ideas: a theater that does not comment on life, but that takes part in it.

=520  \\$aThis play posits a question: what if Death ruled the world? In order to probe an answer, 'Proyecto Piloto' explores a dark underbelly of disgusting creatures and diverse representations of death, mainly skeletons and ghosts. Instead of a majestic Death governing human destinies, we have four unimportant deaths, who defend their petty interests amid the chaos surrounding them. These different 'Deaths' fight to build their new order and advance their clearly absurd projects in an equally absurd manner. They are all fighting in a dark and damp hole, trying to profit from chaos and confusion. The grotesque, tragicomic nonsense of the play evokes the nightmare and violence of Colombian politics at the end of the '80s, the years of Guerra Sucia. Teatro Experimental de Cali (TEC) is a collective of playwrights, actors, dancers, musicians, stage designers and students committed to the exploration and creation of new languages for Latin American theater. Founded in Colombia in 1955 by Enrique Buenaventura and a group of students at the Instituto Departamental de Bellas Artes, TEC has had a long and fruitful trajectory; their artistic and theoretical work has revolutionized the way that theater is conceived and practiced in Latin America. A key contribution to the field is their method of 'creación colectiva' ('collective creation'), in which all the participants of the play - including the audience - become involved with the dramatic text and its staging. In spite of this stress on collective work, TEC had in Enrique Buenaventura its main poet and playwright, who developed most of TEC's texts and directed the majority of their plays. While TEC's works address various historical and social issues, artistic quality is not sacrificed for the sake of political radicalism. TEC has thus created a theater that is politically and culturally engaged, poetic and innovative without losing its popular appeal.

=520  \\$aIn this collectively created play, La Candelaria wanted to address the problem of social and political violence in Colombia through an exploration of both verbal and non-verbal languages (the latter given special emphasis). 'El Paso' looks like a road bar, a place where people go to rest or have something to eat while traveling across the country. The truth is it is a kind of no-place surrounded by violence and social conflicts. The characters constantly refer to issues from the outside as if political violence and other danger exist only outside, and the bar was a haven. However, violence makes its way into the bar: two shady characters irrupt in the bar's status quo, forcefully involving the patrons, employees and passers-by in their shady business. The people at the bar need to negotiate their complicity or resistance to the illegal activities performed by the two newcomers, who with their guns and money set an atmosphere of fear and violence in an otherwise uneventful crossroad's 'cantina'. La Candelaria was founded in 1966 by a group of independent artists and intellectuals who came from experimental theater and the broader Colombian cultural movement. Directed by Santiago García, La Candelaria (www.teatrolacandelaria.org.co) is one of Colombian theater's most innovative agents, modernizing national drama while addressing popular audiences. By means of an ongoing exploration of national folklore, situations and characters, they have created some of Colombia's most compelling plays, some of them through the method of 'creación colectiva' (collective creation), addressing the acute social and political problems of their society. At the same time, they fostered the creation of Corporación Colombiana del Teatro and have developed a number of theoretical works that reflect upon dramatic creation, its methods and languages. Still nowadays, La Candelaria is committed to repertoire, experimentation, and discussion as fundamental elements to artistic creation.

=520  \\$aA folklore band tells the story of Guadalupe Salcedo's murder, one of the first Colombian 'guerrilleros' of the Liberal party. The band works as a Greek Chorus. Through the intervention of this Chorus and other narrative strategies (like a trial and a press conference), the play reconstructs the social and political context of this ominous murder, part of the endless string of violent deaths caused by political violence in Colombia. La Candelaria goes back to the historical origin of this violence (the fight between Liberals and Conservatives for national supremacy and its disastrous effects for the rural poor) in order to offer an interpretation of its persistence. Guadalupe Salcedo was one of the first victims of political violence in Colombia. The play ends, as it begins, with his murder. Likewise, political violence in Colombia seems cyclical and never ending. The play explicitly connects the 50s to the present. La Candelaria (www.teatrolacandelaria.org.co) was founded in 1966 by a group of independent artists and intellectuals who came from experimental theater and the broader Colombian cultural movement. Directed by Santiago García, La Candelaria is one of Colombian theater's most innovative agents, modernizing national drama while addressing popular audiences.

=520  \\$aRosa Luisa Márquez (www.marquezmartorell.org) is a Puerto Rican theater artist and pedagogue; she specializes in contemporary theater. Rosa Luisa started her teaching career at the theater department of the University of Puerto Rico in 1978. She developed the current curriculum of Drama Activities, which she teaches in her workshops at schools, prisons, rehab centers, women's shelters and community centers. Her directing projects include 'Romeo(s) y Julieta(s),' 'Historias para ser Contadas,' 'La Leyenda del Cemí,' 'Procesión,' 'Waiting for Godot,' 'Jardín de Pulpos,' 'Absurdos en Soledad,' 'El León y la Joya,' among others. Published books include 'Brincos y saltos: el juego como disciplina teatral' and 'Historias para ser contadas, montaje de Rosa Luisa Márquez.' She is a member of the board of directors and pedagogical team for the EITALC's International School of Latin American and Caribbean Theater. Ongoing artistic collaborators include Gilda Navarra and Antonio Martorell (Puerto Rico), Grupo Malayerba (Ecuador), Grupo Yuyachkani (Peru), and directors Peter Shumann (Bread & Puppet Theater, U.S.A.) and Augusto Boal (Theater of the Oppressed, Brazil). In conjunction with visual artist Antonio Martorell, she created the concept of 'Teatreros Ambulantes' (Itinerant Performers, 1987-1990), resulting in twelve productions. 'El Sí-Da' is one of these projects. Originally staged in 1988 on the World's AIDS Day (in a time when AIDS and condoms were still taboo in Puerto Rico), this is a re-staging made in 1991 for health educators. The performance is inspired in Augusto Boal's 'image theater,' proposing images based on common prejudices and attitudes related to sexuality and AIDS, as a provocation to reflect and discuss new interpretations and alternatives to these social and health issues. The audience is invited to join the performers in creating and transforming images, exploring alternatives for the transformation of current social attitudes towards AIDS

=520  \\$aRudy Martins My Place is a semi autobiographical work that describes Martin's complex relationship with his mother, which has been further complicated by his move to New York City from New Mexico to pursue his dreams of being a playwright and actor. Their main line of communication has become the telephone, which has come to represent his mother's presence within his apartment. The telephone helps Martin to adjust to his new circumstances and he uses it to maintain connections to his roots back home and to form new connections in his new home in New York City. Rudy Martin (1951-1993), a Tewa/Navajo/Apache Indian from New Mexico was a talented lyricist, singer, and musician who was committed to educating the non-Indian public about Indians on and off the reservation. Martin worked as the public relations director for the American Indian Community House (AICH) in New York City. He also served as a character consultant for PBS's children's television series Shining Time Station and earned his master of Fine Arts degree from New York Universitys Tisch School of The Arts. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city. AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto neighborhood serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area. The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICHs Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICHs visual and performing arts department programs. Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badgers Corner.

=520  \\$a'Amarillo, azul y blanco,' a video by Ramón García, documents a traveling, public performance art event created by renowned Cuban artist Manuel Mendive. Brightly-painted dancing bodies journey through Lenin Park (Havana), San Juan river (Matanzas) and Oasis Hotel (Varadero) in a performance of embodied syncretism, a dance of colors - 'yellow, blue and white,' the title of the piece - echoing both the basic language of visual artists and the distinctive colors of Santería deities - the colors of Ochún, Yemayá and Changó. Mendive blends significant elements of Afro-Cuban culture, creating a personal universe intimately linked to his particular worldview, one that establishes organic connections between nature and religion, African ancestry and Caribbean everyday life, a symphony of syncretism that, like all of Mendive's art, reflects a life of commitment to African spiritual practices, a commitment that became more intense after his first visits to Africa in the early 1980s. Manuel Mendive Hoyo (www.mendive.cult.cu) is perhaps the single most important Cuban artist today. Mendive, a major exponent of contemporary 'Afro-cubanismo' in the visual arts, was born in 1944 into a Santería-practicing family. He graduated from the prestigious Academia de Artes Plásticas San Alejandro in Havana in 1962 with honors in sculpture and painting. He held his first one-man show at the Center of Art in Havana in 1964. Since then he has exhibited in some of the most important international venues. The Cuban booth at the XLII International Biennial Exhibition of Modern Art in Venice in 1988 was completely dedicated to his works. His work can be found in Museums and galleries in many countries including the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes in Havana, the Musee d'Art Moderne in Paris; as well as museums in Russia, Somalia, Congo, Norway, Denmark, Finland and the U.S and other countries. He is well-known not only for his painting and soft sculpture, but for his performance pieces in which he paints dancers' naked bodies and creates theatrical backdrops and environments. Representing an important strain of Cuban life, Mendive's multi-media work reflects his syncretic take on religion, philosophy, ethnography, art and dance.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of Heiner Müller's 'Medea Material,' the first production of the Mapa Teatro's 'Müller cycle.' This musical theater production features Colombian mezzo-soprano Martha Senn as Medea, along with a chamber ensemble formed by members of the Philarmonic Orchestra of Bogotá. Constructed out of huge sheets of wrapped cloth, the figure of Medea towers over her subjects and creators in a classic and surrealistic representation of tragedy, magic and myth. After the documentation of the performance, this video includes close-up shots of the diverse characters, showing details of their make-up, their costumes, and the stage. The aesthetic and visual achievement of this production, as well as its showcase of Colombian musical talent, brought considerable recognition to Mapa Teatro in the first decade of its artistic development.
=520  \\$aOne of the foremost artistic companies in Colombia, Mapa Teatro (www.mapateatro.org) has been producing theater, performance and art installation projects since 1984. Founders and directors, Rolf and Heidi Abderhalden have created a wide ranging repertoire of theater, opera, mixed-media performance, and site-specific installation. Their work proposes richly textured visual metaphors in which they consider often complex psychological, social and political relationships. Committed to experimentation, and less interested in the actor as an 'agent of fiction,' they describe their project as 'a laboratory of social imagination,' that offers a space for presenting community issues and human concerns in media and performance. This combination of real-life situations and sites along with highly stylized aesthetic staging produces a tension between real action and (re)presentation. Mapa Teatro draws from live events captured on video such as the demolition of a neighborhood in Bogotá, ritual practice, and texts that explore the relationship of postmodern subjects, myth and metaphor. Mapa Teatro has performed by commissions, festivals and collaborative projects world-wide.

=520  \\$aFarcical cabaret performance featuring Enrique Alonso, whose legendary character 'Cachirulo' starred Mexico's first TV show for kids 'Teatro Fantástico.' Cachirulo presents a satiric rendition of Oscar Wilde's 'The Selfish Giant' in the light of the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) by Mexican president Carlos Salinas. In 'a land far, far away, in a big city affected by the citizens' carelessness, but that thanks to the government... was totally devastated,' a little girl with an 'uncanny' resemblance to President Salinas meets a vagabond who gives her terrible news: a dangerous giant ('a subproduct of civil indignation for electoral fraud') approaches the city intending to rebel from the abuses of political tyranny. The giant indeed arrives, and destroys the public garden (for which the girl calls him 'selfish'). 
=520  \\$aHe is then approached by villains Fanfarrón and Escaldufa (the latter a witch, here impersonating the United States), who intend to render him 'politically unconscious' and make him an ally in their agenda of destruction. Cachirulo helps the girl look for a magic elixir that can counter the villains' evil influence. With the aid of three magic talismans, they dodge the villains' repeated attacks, but Escaldufa ultimately outsmarts them by dressing up like 'the NAFTA fairy.' She proposes the girl to barter the control of all the hemisphere in exchange for an elixir that erases any political 'mishandling.' Sealed the agreement, the girl makes a public speech promising to magically transform Mexico into a First World country, but instead wishes for hair and pours the elixir over her bald head, emptying the bottle in the process.   
=520  \\$aWith no more elixir to transform the country, the girl resorts to the argument that 'it is not with exotic formulas that the country will improve, we require patience, strength, unity.' Cachirulo, indignant, interrupts the political speech, silencing the girl and ending the story. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodríguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a chameleon, Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her espectáculos (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and carpa, to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions.   
=520  \\$aShe seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguezs energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances.   
=520  \\$aJesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: I am going to die with that woman. Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. In this off-off space, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas, Jesusa y Liliana have produced hundreds of shows since the 1980s.

=520  \\$aThis is a hand-held video documentation of an evening of cabaret performance at El Hábito in 1991. It is not a play, but rather a free-flowing interaction between the performers/hostesses and the audience. Liliana Felipe walks on stage wearing a Viking hat and a skin-tight blue bodysuit, helping 'Pita Amor' (an elderly Mexican poetess, played by Jesusa Rodríguez) to her seat. While Liliana plays well-known songs from her repertoire, Pita Amor reads poems, jokes with the audience, orders Liliana around, and comments on everything from love, to the government, to feminism, all peppered with the periodical request for 'un drink' and her repeated assertion 'How I hate physical decay!' Among the audience members are Marta Lamas, founder and director of Debate Feminista (a leading feminist journal in Mexico) and Elena Poniatowska, one of Mexico's most renowned literary figures, about whom Liliana sings a song at the end of the show. 
=520  \\$aThis video is a testimony to the kind of space El Hábito is: a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodríguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a 'chameleon,' Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her 'espectáculos' (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and 'carpa,' to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions.   
=520  \\$aShe seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguez's energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances.   
=520  \\$aJesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: 'I am going to die with that woman.' Since then, Liliana and Jesusa ('married' in February 2000) have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. In these off-off spaces, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas, Jesusa y Liliana have produced hundreds of shows since the 1980s.

=520  \\$aUnedited video documentation of cabaret performance by renowned artists Jesusa Rodríguez and Liliana Felipe. 'El ejido en Navidad', in the tradition of the yearly 'pastorelas' (Nativity plays) performed at the Teatro Bar El Hábito in Mexico City, poses a satiric critique to current political events in Mexico's public sphere. Presented as a fairytale-gone-wrong (presented by Cachirulo, legendary children's TV character by Enrique Alonso, and 'betwitched' by Cachirulo's TV characters Bruja Escaldufa and Fanfarrón), the piece poses an anti-Establishment take on the agrarian reforms proposed by then President Carlos Salinas de Gortari (through his controversial Ammendment to Article 27 of Mexico's Constitution). These reforms directly affected the organizational units known as 'ejidos' - hence the Spanish pun between 'el ejido' ('the ejido') and 'elegido' ('the Chosen One', a Christian epithet common in Nativity plays). Corruption, embezzlement and political violence roam rural Mexico while legendary political figures and fictional characters visit an impoverished, disempowered peasant couple. The constant abuses, endured patiently by the peasantry and indigenous peoples, evidence how political promises of progress and of inclusion in the 'national project' end up as nightmares of oppression for millions of Mexicans through history. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodríguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a 'chameleon,' Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her 'espectáculos' (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and 'carpa,' to performative acts within political projects.

She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguez's energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation.

=520  \\$aThis cabaret performance is a satiric homage to Mexico's famous songwriter Francisco Gabilondo, whose children's radio show, broadcasted for almost 30 years (1934-1961) introduced the iconic character 'Cri-Cri, El Grillito Cantor' ('Cri-Cri, The Little Singing Grasshopper'). Jesusa Rodríguez, playing the part of a sadistic elementary schoolteacher, orchestrates a 'recital of fifth graders' (featuring Mexican singers Adriana Díaz de León and Eugenia León, along with the cast from cabaret ensemble Divas), where Gabilondo's songs are juxtaposed with satiric interpretations, confronting naive lyrics with violent behavior, drug dealing, graffiti painting, etc. Their social critique is highlighted by the attitude of Rodríguez's character, a religious teacher aligned to the government in power, whose prejudices are evident in her attempt to conduct a 'didactic tribute' while insulting the songwriter, the audience, and the students. 
=520  \\$aThe 'homage,' comprising nineteen well-known Cri-Cri songs like 'La marcha de las letras,' 'La muñeca fea,' 'Di ¿por qué?,' 'El comal y la olla,' and 'El chorrito,' features Paz Águila (famous Mexican bolero singer of the duet 'Las Hermanas Águila'), with an ensemble of 'grasshopper' musicians directed by Liliana Felipe. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodréguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a chameleon, Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her espectáculos (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and carpa, to performative acts within political projects.   
=520  \\$aHumor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguezs energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances.   
=520  \\$aJesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: I am going to die with that woman. Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. In this off-off space, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas, Jesusa y Liliana have produced hundreds of shows since the 1980s.

=520  \\$aFramed by two male figures dressed in tuxedos, a Puerto Rican woman relives the timeless folktales of love and wisdom told by the women of her family for generations. She is a passionate poet and writer, invested in celebrating her own heritage while at the same time challenging the definitions of womanhood and romance passed on by generations of women in her family. She constantly navigates the dual identity formed by having grown up in two very different worlds: the tropical island and 'Los Nuevayores' (that other place away from the island.) By way of her grandmother, she is a skilled and eloquent storyteller. Her companions are two parts of the same man, one being Spanish dominant and the other English dominant. They both give life to the eternal inhabitant of the poetic world created by the writer: a Latino leading man. They are able to embody her varying definitions of manhood. 
=520  \\$aForm a menacing thief that terrorized the Caribbean during the 18th Century, to a gentle young man brought up as a girl by his widowed mother, to the author's memory of her father. 'The Wedding March' premiered at Pregones @ St. Ann's in The Bronx NY, in 1991. Founded in 1979 and based in The Bronx, New York City, Pregones Theater (http://www.pregones.org) has performed in more than 400 cities and 13 countries. The company enjoys citywide recognition for their lasting contributions to the performing arts field and are recipients of numerous distinctions including current Leading National Ensemble Theatre Designation from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and the Andrew W.   
=520  \\$aMellon Foundation, Primary Cultural Institution Designation from the New York State Council on the Arts, the New York State Governor's Arts Award, the Culture & Humanities Award from the Center for Puerto Rican Studies, numerous artist and production awards, as well as invitations to appear at international festivals and events. Over the years Pregones has developed a style that combines theater, music and movement, oral and written traditions, and a signature urban sensibility. The ensemble draws from popular Puerto Rican artistic expressions and literature to create and stage its work. Today, Pregones has grown to be one of the leading Puerto Rican/Latino theater theaters in the United States. From migrations to indigenous mythologies to subway stories, the company's repertoire covers a growing sample of Latino experiences and identities.

=520  \\$aFrom 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a 'new world' - one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America's shifting demographics. From a geographic 'outpost' in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, methods, and production.
=520  \\$aThis video documentation features an interview with Roberta Uno, founder and artistic director of New WORLD Theater at the Fine Arts Center at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst. She gives an account of New WORLD Theater’s historical trajectory, highlighting the fact that working with young performers from diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds require both a critical and committed perspective. Following the mission of providing a multi-cultural space and stage for artists of color, and contrary to the idea of a ‘melting pot,’ she proposes to show the individualities of each tradition, and look for productive dialogues from a comparative approach, which acknowledges and respects similarities and differences. Uno also underlines the importance of funding the theater space through allies in the community and their support to generate a space for cultural diverse work – a work that can only be developed collaboratively. Uno extends this dialogue into the process of reaching out to the local theater community and working directly with individuals to create performance works that defy cultural biases that a traditional framework may impose upon artists of color. In 1991, New WORLD Theater was in itself a big achievement, being ahead of its time as a cultural institution. By the second decade of the 21st century, it is possible not only to see the development of a visionary project, but also to understand Roberta Uno’s awareness of archiving artistic pieces, and to organize them by topics so that they can be accessible for researchers and artists.

They describe their work in this way: 'Our work is rooted in popular culture, but positioned against it. It relies on moments rather than plot, relationships rather than story. It depends on the surprise of transformation rather than the logic of psychological narrative. It straddles the line between performance and theater, exploiting theatricality while exposing the pretense. It is about a community of outsiders, queers, eccentrics. It is feminist because it encourages the imaginative potential in everyone and lesbian because it takes the presence of lesbian on stage as a given.' Their vaudevillian satirical gender-bending performances have received numerous awards, including a Jane Chamber award and four Village Voice OBIE awards. Their collection of scripts, 'Split Britches Feminist Performance/Lesbian Practice', edited by Sue Ellen Case, won the 1997 Lambda Literary Award for Drama. This video documents a staged reading of Ginka Steinwachs' text 'Monsieur-Madame'. Directed by Lois Weaver and Peggy Shaw, the performance is a collaboration between Split Britches and legendary queer theater troupes Bloolips and The Five Lesbian Brothers.

=520  \\$aNao Bustamante (www.naobustamante.com) is an internationally known performance artist born in California. Her work encompasses performance art, installation, video, pop music and experimental rips in time. She has performed in galleries, museums, universities and underground sites throughout Asia, Africa, Europe, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Mexico and the United States. She is currently teaching New Media and Live Art at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, New York. 'Indigurrito' is Bustamante's contribution to the many performances that commemorated the 500 anniversary of the conquest of America. The title mixes the term 'indigenous' with 'burrito', the name of the famous Mexican wrap. In the performance, Bustamante challenged the white men in the audience to go onstage to express their apologies for the years of oppression of indigenous peoples by eating a piece of a burrito that Bustamante had strapped on to her hips. With humor and sarcasm, Bustamante addressed the issues that the 500-year commemoration brought to collective attention. Her piece also denounces how art institutions forced artists to pay tribute to the date if they wanted to get funding.

=520  \\$aCarlos Celdrán and Flora Lauten's version of "La increíble y triste historia de la cándida Eréndira y su abuela desalmada", the famous story by renowned Colombian writer Gabriel García Márquez, is a theatrical exploration of intimacy, nostalgia and divestment. The creative process was deeply invested in the investigation of the expressive possibilities of the dramaturgy of the actor, the characters and the essential myth within the story, in order to unveil the hidden metaphor of Eréndira. Teatro Buendía, formed in 1986 by graduates from the Higher Institute of Arts, Havana, and directed by Flora Lauten, is Cuba's most celebrated theater company. Since its foundation, they have developed two parallel lines of work: the production of theater spectacles, and a permanent research center investigating Latin American and Caribbean cultural traditions, the expressive possibilities of the actor, and the renewal of scenic languages. The study of the possible relations between music, dance, and interpretation, as well as the formulation of new forms of scenic writing and dramaturgy of the spectacle, have consolidated Teatro Buendía's international prestige as a company that has presented their repertoire in the most demanding festivals and venues of Latin America, Europe, North America, Asia, Africa and Australia, all to critical acclaim. They also tour internationally giving workshops, seminars and conferences on their cultural investigations and creative methods.

Huipil, presents these stories, along with traditional music, hand choreography and rap, woven together the way a traditional huipil is woven on a back-strap loom. This is our personal statement of our role in the universe, community, and family, as sisters and as women. Theses stories symbolize our strength and survival. Elvira and Hortencia Colorado, Chichimec Otomi storytellers, playwrights, performers and community activists are founding members of Coatlicue Theatre Company (www.coatlicue.com). They are also members of Danza Mexica Cetiliztli, New York Zapatistas and the American Indian Community House. The company's plays address social, political, cultural and identity issues that impact their lives and their community. Their work is based on stories they weave together which educate as well as entertain, while reaffirming their survival as urban Native American women. They have conducted storytelling/ theatre workshops. They are recipients of the Ingrid Washinawatok Community Activism Award. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city. AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto neighborhood serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area. The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICHs Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICHs visual and performing arts department programs. Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badgers Corner.

=520  \\$aCollective creation by Teatro La Máscara, a free version of a series of poems in 'For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow is Enuf' by American writer Ntozake Shange. The poems, revolving around feminine stories, characters and issues, were performed in the diverse rooms of the empty house in the San Antonio neighborhood in Cali, Colombia, where La Máscara eventually built their theater. Teatro La Máscara is the oldest - and one of the only - feminist, all-women's theater in Colombia. Founded in 1972 in Cali, La Máscara was a political theater initially comprised of male as well as female actors; by the early 1980s, when only the women stayed and wanted to continue the theatrical trajectory of the group, Lucy Bolaños decided to make La Máscara a women's ensemble fully dedicated to a feminine dramaturgy on gender issues. Committed to feminism and social change, they have stayed true to this mission, despite the many social and economic pressures they've had to endure in an environment plagued by violence and machismo, which constantly seeks to 'invisibilize' their work. Because of their fruitful stubbornness, La Máscara is not only creating and staging plays, but also working with marginalized communities, actively participating in political protests and demonstrations, and being involved in the organization of theater festivals. Through their work, they keep re-thinking women's role in the construction of a peaceful Colombia.

Hanay Geiogamah was born in Lawton, Oklahoma in 1945. He studied journalism at the University of Oklahoma and earned his Bachelor of Arts in Theater and Drama from the University of Indiana in 1980. He has taught at Colorado College, the University of Washington, and the University of California at Los Angeles, and is one of the founders of the American Indian Theater Ensemble and co-founder of the American Indian Dance Theater. Geiogamah is known for plays in which he employs humor, realism, and idiomatic language to subvert negative stereotypes about Native Americans and to address the alienation felt by Indians in contemporary American society.

Interviews with writers, fellow professors, theater critics, university students, visual artists and other collaborators are juxtaposed to footage and pictures from performances and public interventions, along with running commentary by the artist herself, dancer and choreographer Alejandra Martorell, and partner-in-art for over twenty years Antonio Martorell. This documentary is a valuable archive of Rosa Luisas work during these years as well as an excellent document on the manifold provocations, creative coordinates and characteristic traits of Márquezs artistic and pedagogical works. Rosa Luisa Márquez (www.marquezmartorell.org) is a Puerto Rican theatre artist and pedagogue. Founding member of the theater group Anamú in 1971, she holds a masters degree from New York University and a Doctorate from Michigan State University; she specializes in contemporary theater. Rosa Luisa started her teaching career at the Theater department of the University of Puerto Rico in 1978. She developed the current curriculum of Drama Activities, which she teaches in her workshops at schools, prisons, rehab centers, womens shelters, nursing homes and community centers. Her directing projects include Romeo(s) y Julieta(s), Historias para ser Contadas, La Leyenda del Cemí, Procesión, Waiting for Godot, Jardín de Pulpos, Absurdos en Soledad, El León y la Joya, among others. In conjunction with Puerto Rican visual artist Antonio Martorell, she created the concept of Itinerant Performers (1987-1990) resulting in twelve productions. Published books include Brincos y saltos: el juego como disciplina teatral and Historias para ser contadas, montaje de Rosa Luisa Márquez. She is a member of the board of directors and pedagogical team for the EITALCs International School of Latin American and Caribbean Theater. Ongoing artistic collaborators include Gilda Navarra and Antonio Martorell (Puerto Rico), Grupo Malayerba (Ecuador), Grupo Yuyachkani (Peru), and directors Peter Shumann (Bread & Puppet Theater, U.S.A.) and Augusto Boal (Theater of the Oppressed, Brazil).

=520  \\$aDress rehearsal for the performance "Si el grano no muere..." directed by Rosa Luisa Márquez and Antonio Martorell in the context of their 10-day residency at MIT in 1992. Involving MIT students, high school students and members of the Latino communities in Boston and Cambridge, and featuring metaphorical references to "grains", with sets made of corn tortilla, bread, pasta, rice, and other disposable materials, the performance addresses issues of food and shelter that are of social and political concern to the community. The resulting multicultural, multilingual performance involves the audience in a "cultural pot luck", a communal "voyage of discovery".

=520  \\$aHot N Soft is a lesbian erotica/ trickster story created by Muriel Miguel (Kuna-Rappahannock), a founding member of Spiderwoman Theater, the longest running Native women's theater troupe. After encountering only male trickster stories, Miguel decided to build a piece around a female lesbian coyote trickster (the Coyote often plays the role of trickster and is usually male). Adding erotica to the mix, Miguel bases her tale on taboos not normally spoken of in the Native lesbian community, hair, two-timing, being uncomfortable, and getting older. Spiderwoman Theater is the longest continuous running Native female performance group. Comprised of three Kuna/ Rappahannock sisters from Brooklyn, New York, Lisa Mayo, Gloria Miguel, and Muriel Miguel, the group has travel all over the world giving performance, lectures, and workshops. Named after the weaver in the Hopi creation story the sisters storyweave their message in a variety of formats including poetry, dance, theater, and song. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city. AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto neighborhood serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area. The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICHs Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICHs visual and performing arts department programs. Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badgers Corner. Indian Summer is an annual event at AICH and an occasion for artists to present their latest works to the community and the general public. All performers, whether new to the field or veteran practitioners, are encouraged to present their work.

The Coatlicue Theater Company and Spiderwoman Theater presented excerpts from several of their plays. The Minneapolis Indigenous People's Task Forces Native Youth Theater Group, directed by Spiderwomans Muriel Miguel, also performed. The Group, led by Sharon Day, the Director of the Minneapolis Indigenous Peoples Task Force, had been selected and invited by the Community House to write and perform works about HIV/AIDS as a way to educate youth about various aspects of the disease during gay pride week.

=520  \\$aThis is a video documentation of a psycho-sexual empowering journey where performer and audience share intimacy, humor, and affects. Tim Miller explores bits and pieces of his body, in the same manner than, piece by piece, the story keeps flowing and ‘giving birth’ to the queer body. Through storytelling and movement, and stories of love, enchantment, disenchantment, and resistance, this solo show transforms a personal story into the story of a community. The ghost of fear and death appears with the AIDS epidemic, the loss of friends and loved ones, police brutality against gay people, and the State of California anti gay laws and homophobic harassment. A travel in time through the body, Tim Miller’s striking performance invokes the bodies of those who are absent but present at the same time. The gesture of envisioning a future with a United States’ lesbian president, with sexual freedom, and without homophobia, transforms sex into a call to life and hope.
=520  \\$aTim Miller is an internationally acclaimed performance artist. Miller's creative work as a performer and writer explores the artistic, spiritual and political topography of his identity as a gay man. Miller's performances have been presented all over North America, Australia, and Europe in such prestigious venues as Yale Repertory Theatre, the Institute of Contemporary Art (London), the Walker Art Center (Minneapolis), and the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Miller’s most recent book 1001 BEDS, an anthology of his performances, essays and journals, was published by University of Wisconsin Press in 2006. Miller has taught performance at UCLA, NYU, the School of Theology at Claremont and at universities all over the US. He is a co-founder of two of the most influential performance spaces in the United States: Performance Space 122 on Manhattan's Lower East Side and Highways Performance Space in Santa Monica, CA. After a nine-year stint in New York City, in 1987 Miller returned home to Los Angeles, California where he was born and raised. He currently lives there with his partner Alistair in Venice Beach.

=520  \\$aThis two-woman, one skeleton 'prehispanic' cabaret follows the trajectory of a soul traversing the nine levels of a pre-Hispanic underworld. An indigenous woman mourns her dead lover, and decides to go to 'el cielo de abajo' ('the sky below') to look for her. The journey roughly follows the route mapped out in the Nahuas' sacred text 'Popul Voh,' as well as in Alfredo López Austin's book 'Cuerpo humano e ideología: Las concepciones de los antiguos nahuas' (The Human Body and Ideology: The Ideas of the Ancient Nahuas). The script, partly Spanish and partly Nahuatl (the language of the so-called Aztecs) is loosely based on a prehispanic conception of the afterlife of mortal souls during their arduous trip to their final resting place. Ultimately, this cabaret performance poses a poetic exploration of love, gender, seduction, sacrifice, and death. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodríguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a 'chameleon,' Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her 'espectáculos' (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and 'carpa,' to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguez's energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: 'I am going to die with that woman.' Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. In this off-off space, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas, Jesusa y Liliana have produced hundreds of shows since the 1980s.

=520  \\$aThis is a promotional video featuring performers from the play ‘Miss Ida B. Wells,’ written by Endesha Ida Mae Holland, and directed by Roberta Uno. The performers discuss Ida B. Well’s political involvement with anti-slavery activism. They state that the purpose of the play is to bring light and attention to Ida B. Well’s political work. Roberta Uno points out how the play generates discussion around political issues, and she also talks about how New WORLD Theater is a social stage that brings theater to communities, and functions as an open cultural platform for theater artist of color. The artists involved in this performance believe that Miss Ida B. Wells educates audience members and gives them a better understanding of cultural diversity.
=520  \\$aFrom 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a ‘new world’—one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting demographics. From a geographic ‘outpost’ in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, methods, and production. One of New WORLD Theater’s artistic legacies is Project 2050, an early call to imagine the U.S. demographic shift, with people of the future — youth, in equal collaboration with artists and scholars.

=520  \\$aJosé, a man who has lost his memory, wanders along a country that he no longer feels his own, a place that no longer holds affective ties, personal memories linking him to a community. One day he meets Toña, a woman of great kindness, alienated due to a profound lack of affection. She tells him that in a nearby beach, many years ago, people used to go to sleep and dream a collective dream and that, in this dream, theirs pasts and the characters who lived there show up once again. José, conflicted by his loss of memory decides to go to this beach to dream in order to build, out of dreams, his lost identity. 'Jardín de pulpos' ('Octopus's Garden') is a journey through memory and identity, a painful metaphor of losses and absences, a space of the subconscious where Latin America's collective imagery wanders amidst its struggles, exiles, and oblivion. This video documents key excerpts from Malayerba's renowned production. The Grupo de Teatro Malayerba (teatromalayerba.org) was founded in Quito in 1979 by Arístides Vargas, Susana Pautasso and María del Rosario 'Charo' Francés, immigrant actors originally from Argentina and Spain. From the start, Malayerba included actors with various backgrounds and nationalities, invested in the exploration of the rich cultural diversity and complex history of Ecuador, as well as issues of migration, exile, political violence and individual and collective memory. With over 25 years of ongoing theater practice and more than 20 plays performed locally and internationally for a diverse audience, Malayerba is committed to theater pedagogy and experimentation, artistic collaboration, and community building. They have represented Ecuador in national and international theater festivals; they have also collaborated with theater groups within Ecuador and in other countries, and performed for both film and television, while engaging in community work in Quito. In 1989 the group created the Laboratorio Malayerba, committed to the training of generations of young Ecuadorian actors and to an ongoing investigation of theories and practices of experimental theater. In 2001 Malayerba launched the theater journal 'Hoja de Teatro,' conceived as a forum for the theorization, criticism and dissemination of Ecuadorian theater practices. The group also runs a theater house, the Casa Malayerba, which houses the Laboratory as well as a theater with seating capacity for seventy people. Malayerba approaches theater making as an artistic, ethical and technical realm where to engage in meaningful creative experiences through which to understand, assume and confront current sociopolitical processes. In working together, actors with various backgrounds and nationalities have shown that a multicultural blend is not only possible but also enriching, as differences lead to new identities, embodiments of dreams, memories, absences and pains that are at once local and universal.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of Puerto Rican experimental dance performance ‘Kan’t Translate – Tradúcelo,’ choreographed by Viveca Vázquez and performed in the University of Puerto Rico. Viveca Vázquez is a choreographer, dancer, and a professor of humanities and contemporary dance for actors at the University of Puerto Rico. She presented her first work with Pisotón, the first experimental dance group of Puerto Rico and, shortly after, Taller de Otra Cosa, of which she became the first director. Through the company she presented her choreographic work and produced events such as ‘Rompeforma’ a key festival in the development of the experimental dance and performance scene in Puerto Rico, which was co-produced with Puerto Rican choreographer based in the U.S. Merian Soto. Since 1984 she has produced and performed experimental dance works in the United States, Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina, among a great number of other places. As a teacher she has developed a pedagogical model based on body conscience and improvisation.
=520  \\$a‘Kan’t Translate’ explores the idea of speaking bodies on stage and questions the language that we pretend to ‘understand.’ The second part of the title, ‘Tradúcelo’ (Translate it), addresses the audience, and shows a trusting in the capacity of communication through the language of the body. This piece contrasts harmony and rupture, as well as individual movements and group movements, exploring a different notion of the idea of ‘choreography.’ Also, the continuous alternation between absences and presences on stage dialogues with the video insert that presents a letter to ‘Dear Mr. Governor, Majesty,’ which becomes another kind of ‘presence’ on stage, both made of words and rooted in political power. The last part of this performance explores the language of dance and theatre, and incorporates humor as another form of communication and political satire.

=520  \\$aSince 1981, the Split Britches Company (founded by Lois Weaver, Peggy Shaw, and Deb Margolin, www.splitbritches.com) has written and performed in trio, duet, and solo, as well as collaborated and performed with other artists. They describe their work in this way: 'Our work is rooted in popular culture, but positioned against it. It relies on moments rather than plot, relationships rather than story. It depends on the surprise of transformation rather than the logic of psychological narrative. It straddles the line between performance and theater, exploiting theatricality while exposing the pretense. It is about a community of outsiders, queers, eccentrics. It is feminist because it encourages the imaginative potential in everyone and lesbian because it takes the presence of lesbian on stage as a given.' Their vaudevillian satirical gender-bending performances have received numerous awards, including a Jane Chamber award and four Village Voice OBIE awards. Their collection of scripts, 'Split Britches Feminist Performance/Lesbian Practice', edited by Sue Ellen Case, won the 1997 Lambda Literary Award for Drama. This video documents a work-in-progress by Lois Weaver and Peggy Shaw, staged at experimental theater venue Dixon Place in New York City in 1992. An informal evening on issues of butch-femme, gender and 'queer', it is a collaboration with artists Vicky Genfan, Claire Moed and Leslie Feinberg. The resulting piece is a vaudevillian satirical gender-bending performance 'for your theoretical entertainment'.

=520  \\$aDrum Lives, performed by Nic Billey and Ben Geboe, is a 1993 HIV awareness piece that also addressed issues concerning alcohol abuse, substance abuse, and others. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city. AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto neighborhood serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area. The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICHs Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICHs visual and performing arts department programs. Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badgers Corner. Indian Summer is an annual event at AICH and an occasion for artists to present their latest works to the community and the general public. All performers, whether new to the field or veteran practitioners, are encouraged to present their work.

=520  \\$aMoments in Tlalteuctli is the working title for this work in progress. In it, Hortencia and Elvira Colorado, of Coatlicue Theater Company tell stories of environmental and societal violence against women offered as a healing performance for the earth and humanity. The stories examine border exploitation, abuse, the appropriation of culture and spirituality, NAFTA, the dispossession of indigenous people from their land, and the impact of the low intensity war on indigenous communities in Chiapas. Elvira and Hortencia Colorado, Chichimec Otomi storytellers, playwrights, performers and community activists are founding members of Coatlicue Theatre Company (www.coatlicue.com). They are also members of Danza Mexica Cetiliztli, New York Zapatistas and the American Indian Community House. The company's plays address social, political, cultural and identity issues that impact their lives and their community. Their work is based on stories they weave together which educate as well as entertain, while reaffirming their survival as urban Native American women. They have conducted storytelling/ theatre workshops. They are recipients of the Ingrid Washinawatok Community Activism Award. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city. AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto neighborhood serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area. The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICHs Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICHs visual and performing arts department programs. Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badgers Corner. Indian Summer is an annual event at AICH and an occasion for artists to present their latest works to the community and the general public. All performers, whether new to the field or veteran practitioners, are encouraged to present their work.

=520  \\$aFOMMA - Fortaleza de la Mujer Maya - is a collective of Mayan women who use theater as a tool for education and community building. They are performers, playwrights, and teachers who tour their work in their communities and internationally, performing plays that focus on women's and indigenous rights, literacy, cultural survival, ecology, health, and education in the Tzeltal and Tzotzil indigenous languages. 'Una mujer desesperada' is a play about domestic violence in which a woman and her daughter are at the mercy of the new husband/stepfather who is an alcoholic and an abusive person. The piece was produced by Sna Jtz'ibajom, the theater company that Isabel Juárez Espinoza and Petrona de la Cruz Cruz were a part of before they founded FOMMA in 1994.

=520  \\$aThis awarded video clip, produced independently, offers a particular reading of Astrid Hadad’s aesthetic proposal through the song ‘Corazón sangrante.’ The video clip immerses itself in the colors, sounds, and moving images of Adelitas and virgins. Hadad’s body and voice are at the center of this imagery, contrasting with landscapes that suggest links between the female body and the Mexican political body. At the same time, the multiplied presence of Astrid Hadad suggests that identities related to gender, sexuality, and politics are not static but mobile and complex.
=520  \\$aAstrid Hadad is a vocalist and performance artist from Mexico. Her work as a solo performance artist took off in 1995 with her show ‘Heavy Nopal.’ The term ‘heavy nopal’ refers to the Mexican cactus distilled to make tequila and is how Hadad describes her style of performance. Her shows follow the format of a cabaret, in which Hadad dazzles her audience with stunning vocals and elaborated costumes. She appropriates iconic images in Mexican culture, straps them to her body, and walks onstage to reconfigure their meanings. Through her voice and her body, Hadad challenges to her audience to adopt her system of cultural processing. Most of her work challenges cultural norms pertaining to gender roles in Mexican society. She also addresses issues of US neo imperialism. Hadad writes, produces, and promotes her own work.

=520  \\$aThis video documentation shows a selection of Astrid Hadad and Los Tarzanes’ songs. In ‘Heavy Nopal,’ Astrid uses Mexican iconic references, like the cactus, the rock, the pyramid, and the tequila bottle. These elements are not just scenery, but they appear also on Hadad’s own body, which so becomes a human, mobile stage, and also an altar. From the calla lilies to the extremely complex surprise-multi-purpose outfits, to the innumerable ornaments, ‘rebozos,’ virgins of Guadalupe, guns, and common places in the essence of Mexico, Astrid Hadad and her Tarzanes transport the audience through several levels of iconography. Through this iconography, Hadad offers different meanings for both the female body and the Mexican political body.

=520  \\$aDanny Hoch (www.dannyhoch.com) is an actor, playwright and director whose plays 'Pot Melting', 'Some People', and 'Jails, Hospitals & Hip-Hop' have garnered many awards including 2 OBIES, a NEA Solo Theatre Fellowship, Sundance Writers Fellowship, CalArts/Alpert Award In Theatre and a Tennessee Williams Fellowship. He is a Senior Fellow at the New School's Vera List Center For Art & Politics and his writings on hip-hop, race and class have appeared in 'The Village Voice' and 'New York Times', among others; his book 'Jails, Hospitals & Hip-Hop' is in its second printing by Villard Books/Random House. Mr. Hoch also founded the 'Hip-Hop Theater Festival' in 2000 which has since presented over 75 hip-hop generation plays from all over the world. A third-generation New Yorker who grew up during the birth of Hip-Hop culture in a multiracial outer-borough neighborhood, Danny brings together his inner monologues, layered composites of stories and voices form his personal experiences, stories of his community and his generation, placing traditionally peripheral characters center stage. Characters like radio personality Caribbean Tiger, Jamaican dancehall entertainer Madman, tenement building handyman Kazmierczack, 'cool' teenagers Floe and Flex, straight-outta-Jersey pseudo-yuppie Bill, fast-paced disc jockey Al Capón, young office worker Blanca, and César, a middle-aged man at his first visit to a therapist, all evidence this outstanding contemporary work, reunited under the title 'Some People', here performed at Performance Space 122 in New York City. An urban griot for the communities of urban North America, Hoch combines Hip-Hop's worldview and expressive strategies of resistance, along with storytelling riffs, actively exploring language in order to move the audience from being passively entertained to become actively engaged.

=520  \\$aWhite Eagle and Pura Fe perform songs written and composed by Rudy Martin (1951-1993). Interspersed between songs, Martin offers insight into the stories and meaning behind his lyrics. Rudy Martin (1951-1993), a Tewa/Navajo/Apache Indian from New Mexico was a talented lyricist, singer, and musician who was committed to educating the non-Indian public about Indians on and off the reservation. Martin worked as the public relations director for the American Indian Community House (AICH) in New York City. He also served as a character consultant for PBS's children's television series Shining Time Station and earned his master of Fine Arts degree from New York Universitys Tisch School of The Arts. Pura Fe (Tuscarora), is a singer, composer, teacher, poet, dancer, and actress. She has studied with the American Ballet Theatre and Martha Graham, and has sung with the Mercer Ellington Orchestra. Fe is the founding member of Ulali, formerly known as Pura Fe, an a cappella Native women's trio that blends a variety of traditional and contemporary indigenous music of the Americas. White Eagle (Rosebud Sioux), was the first American Indian to sing lead roles in American musical theater and opera. He graduated from the prestigious Merola Opera Program at the San Francisco Opera and has performed with the Pennsylvania Opera Theater, Florentine Opera, Cleveland Opera, and others. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city. AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto neighborhood serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area. The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICHs Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICHs visual and performing arts department programs. Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badgers Corner.

Pan-pipes represent life's breath and the drum represents the heartbeat. This is one of several theater pieces in which Spiderwoman Theater critiqued the misuse of Native spirituality by both Native and non-Native people. The group believes that some traditions can and should change, and challenges tradition here by playing the drum despite the opposition of some Native people, who believe women -especially those of childbearing age- should not touch the sacred drum. Spiderwoman Theater is the longest continuous running Native female performance group. Comprised of three Kuna/ Rappahannock sisters from Brooklyn, New York, Lisa Mayo, Gloria Miguel, and Muriel Miguel, the group has travel all over the world giving performance, lectures, and workshops.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of Mapa Teatro's production of Heiner Müller's "Horacio," created with prison inmates of La Picota central penitentiary in Bogotá. This video includes takes from the rehearsal process with the prisoners at La Picota. Rehearsal was interrupted by authorities that peacefully requested that the group leave the stage location. Camera follows the group of actors and the director onto the street appearing to be unintentionally recording the activities with few prolonged and established shots. The camera obscurely captures this live occurrence of their removal and new found location in a prison yard policed by armed men, including friendly banter between the actors and police, large vehicles move in and out of the yard, footage of chained barred fence with groups of uniformed and armed police milling about on both sides as actors board a bus that pulls up inside the yard. Camera follows the group of actors and director from the prison yard by bus to the Camarín del Carmen theater and through pre-show warm-ups, ensemble and personal interviews with the actors. The production is staged in the context of the International Human Rights Day. The play begins 3/4 through the tape. Under a large spotlight on a sparse stage with rope, wire and flowers hanging from the ceiling, the play experiments with the representation of an enclosed space. The project demonstrates the work of the actors' imagination of both mental and physical space as they enact their role through movements, gestures and the manipulation of objects. The video ends approximately 15 minutes into the performance.
=520  \\$aOne of the foremost artistic companies in Colombia, Mapa Teatro (www.mapateatro.org) has been producing theater, performance and art installation projects since 1984. Founders and directors, Rolf and Heidi Abderhalden have created a wide ranging repertoire of theater, opera, mixed-media performance, and site-specific installation. Their work proposes richly textured visual metaphors in which they consider often complex psychological, social and political relationships. Committed to experimentation, and less interested in the actor as an 'agent of fiction', they describe their project as 'a laboratory of social imagination' that offers a space for presenting community issues and human concerns in media and performance. This combination of real-life situations and sites along with highly stylized aesthetic staging produces a tension between real action and (re)presentation. Mapa Teatro draws from live events captured on video such as the demolition of a neighborhood in Bogotá, ritual practice, and texts that explore the relationship of postmodern subjects, myth and metaphor. Mapa Teatro has performed by commissions, festivals and collaborative projects world-wide.

=520  \\$aIn this pedagogical demonstration, Teresa Ralli, one of the original and remaining members of Peruvian theater ensemble Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani, explains her acting technique to a group of British students. Ms. Ralli discusses the artistic training of her body and her voice as well as her approach to character development. Teresa demonstrates that body training stresses body memory, composition and accumulation. In terms of voicework, Ralli discusses the need to find an 'organic' voice and the importance of vocal interpretation; she also demonstrates the importance of breath in voicework. Ms. Ralli believes actors must give the voice a task, a use of the text, and should take the voice out of its 'normal space.' To demonstrate the leap from ordinary to extra-ordinary uses of voice and text, the artist imitates popular Peruvian chants such as slogans commonly used by street vendors; in this demonstration, Ralli switches languages, from English to Spanish to Quechua (an indigenous language of Peru which is rarely spoken by people from outside indigenous communities, but has been consistently incorporated in Yuyachkani's work, turning into one of the ensemble's distinguishing elements). This pedagogical demonstration also includes object manipulation work, including exercises that explore the weight, balance and center of diverse objects. In order to illustrate her research on the subject, Ralli includes a demonstration of her work with chairs, which is a fundamental part of the Yuyachkani technique in object-work. Finally, the artist shows the audience some aspects of character development, demonstrating diverse stages in the creation of one of her characters, 'El Chusco,' featured in 'Músicos Ambulantes,' a musical spectacle created by Yuyachkani in 1983 and still performed today. Weight, balance, volume, flows of energy and centers of balance, showcased in this demonstration, are central aspects in Yuyachkani's (re)search of what they term an 'actor múltiple' or 'multiple actor,' a performer who explores and embodies the interplay between technique and sensitive/bodily memory. Peru's most important theatre collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani (www.yuyachkani.org) has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. 'Yuyachkani' is a Quechua word that means 'I am thinking, I am remembering'; under this name, the theatre group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru. The group is comprised of seven actors (Augusto Casafranca, Amiel Cayo, Ana Correa, Débora Correa, Rebeca Ralli, Teresa Ralli, and Julián Vargas), a technical designer (Fidel Melquíades), and an artistic director (Miguel Rubio), who have made a commitment to collective creation as a mode of theatrical production and to group theater as a life style. Their work has been among the most important in Latin America's so called 'New Popular Theater,' with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy. Yuyachkani won Peru's National Human Rights Award in 2000. Known for its creative embrace of both indigenous performance forms as well as cosmopolitan theatrical forms, Yuyachkani offers insight into Peruvian and Latin American theatre, and to broader issues of postcolonial social aesthetics.

=520  \\$aInstalled in the Castle of Chapultepec and conflating the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries, Mexico's former emperor Maximilian of Habsburg, his wife Carlota, and former President Benito Juárez await 'History's judgment.' In the meantime, they entertain themselves -and the audience, a 'flock' to whom thought is prohibited- 'killing time with historic dignity.' The historical characters play betting games of dexterity (betting the political destiny of the fatherland), play political miniature horse races, perform a ballroom gestural dance to Catholicism, and watch a satiric puppet rendition of 'Red Riding Hood' where a girl resembling Mexico's First Lady Marta Sahagún teams up with an American wolf (who is in war with Iraq) in order to kill Grandma Vicenta (resembling President Vicente Fox) and seize political control of the hemisphere. In the meantime, Carlota, historically accused of madness, asks her 'magic' mirror to predict Mexico's 2006 electoral outcome. From Carlota's futuristic mirror (a 'reflecting film'), once 'reloaded,' springs History, who comes to judge the political characters and the problems of Mexico's so-called progress, ultimately deciding to stop the course of historical events. To Carlota's question on who will win the 2006 presidential race, History responds that no one can achieve it except for Mexico's athlete Ana Gabriela Guevara. But the athlete (staged as a transformed/strip-teased Juarez) refuses to get involved in politics, ending the story, and thus leaving History as an open ended question mark. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodríguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a 'chameleon,' Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her 'espectáculos' (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and 'carpa,' to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguez's energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: 'I am going to die with that woman.' Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. In this off-off space, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas, Jesusa y Liliana have produced hundreds of shows since the 1980s.

=520  \\$aSince 1981, the Split Britches Company (founded by Lois Weaver, Peggy Shaw, and Deb Margolin, www.splitbritches.com) has written and performed in trio, duet, and solo, as well as collaborated and performed with other artists. They describe their work in this way: 'Our work is rooted in popular culture, but positioned against it. It relies on moments rather than plot, relationships rather than story. It depends on the surprise of transformation rather than the logic of psychological narrative. It straddles the line between performance and theater, exploiting theatricality while exposing the pretense. It is about a community of outsiders, queers, eccentrics. It is feminist because it encourages the imaginative potential in everyone and lesbian because it takes the presence of lesbian on stage as a given'. Their vaudevillian satirical gender-bending performances have received numerous awards, including a Jane Chamber award and four Village Voice OBIE awards. Their collection of scripts, 'Split Britches Feminist Performance/Lesbian Practice', edited by Sue Ellen Case, won the 1997 Lambda Literary Award for Drama. This video documents their show 'Dress Suits to Hire'. Written by Holly Hughes in collaboration with Peggy Shaw and Lois Weaver, the piece uses images from pulp fiction and film noir to portray the erotic cat-and-mouse relationship between characters Deluxe and Michigan, two women who live in a clothing store. Heated fantasies, brassy broads and sexual charades make for a carnivorous free-for-all. The video also includes a Q&A session with Shaw and Weaver at the end of the performance.

=520  \\$aCoatlicue Theater Company's ‘Blood Speaks’ deals with the pivotal role that religion played in the oppression and genocide of native people. In the course of the play the artists reclaim their voices and begin to rewrite history, in their own terms. This video documentation from 1993 features an early stage of Coatlicue’s theater career, where they were developing and strengthening their aesthetic and political proposal. The play opens with a ritual of the beginning of Earth, in dialogue with the characters’ Mayan/Aztec heritage. The stories and history of cultural struggles, from Spanish conquest and colonization to immigration and border politics, have the female body as a central site of violence.
=520  \\$aElvira and Hortencia Colorado, Chichimec Otomi storytellers, playwrights, performers and community activists are founding members of Coatlicue Theater Company (www.coatlicue.com). They are also members of Danza Mexica Cetiliztli, New York Zapatistas and the American Indian Community House. The company's plays address social, political, cultural, and identity issues that impact their lives and their community. Their work is based on stories they weave together, with which they educate as well as entertain the audience. They have conducted storytelling/ theater workshops, and are recipients of the Ingrid Washinawatok Community Activism Award. In 2013, Coatlicue Theater Company celebrated 25 years of performance, culture, and activism.
=520  \\$aFrom 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a ‘new world’—one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting demographics. From a geographic ‘outpost’ in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, methods, and production. One of New WORLD Theater’s artistic legacies is Project 2050, a multi-year youth arts initiative built on the demographic projection that people of color would become the majority in the United States by 2050. The program brought together professional artists, youth communities from Massachusetts, scholars, and community activists to engage civic dialogue and create original performances based on themes that addressed young performers’ dreams and concerns. Performances were created from workshops that included playwriting, poetry, breakdancing, drumming, beatboxing, lyricism, singing, songwriting, stepping, and visual art.

=520  \\$aFounded in 1965 by Luis Valdez, El Teatro Campesino was initially the cultural wing of the United Farm Workers union in California's central valley. With a pointed political mission, ETC performed their actos in the fields, agitprop improvisations communicated eloquently with the workers, who could neither read nor write, but recognized themselves and their values in the actos. By 1970 ETC had gained an international reputation, with major contributions to Chicano culture in the U.S. and to the development and expansion of the boundaries of theater everywhere. Theirs is a popular theater rooted in the American streets, early California history, Mayan/Aztec mythology and Mexican folklore and spiritualism, all geared toward expression of social, political and cultural perceptions. La Virgen del Tepeyac is ETCs longest running play and is cherished by audience members who come from all around the world to see it performed at the historic old mission of San Juan Bautista, California. Performed every other year since 1971 in concert with La Pastorela, this Christmas pageant was adapted from a four-character liturgical drama written by an anonymous Mexican or Spanish monk in the 18th Century. Valdez reworked the original story to include new characters and scenes, and also introduced music and dance. Importantly, the piece includes Aztec song and dance, adding complex layers to this pageant which embraces both Catholic and Indigenous rituals. Dramatizing the four apparitions of the Virgin of Guadalupe to the indio Juan Diego on the hill of Tepeyac outside Mexico City in 1531, the play climaxes with the miracle of the roses that sealed the conversion of pre-Columbian Mexico to Christianity. The appearance of the Virgen de Guadalupe stands as a beacon, a shining ray of light and hope, across the centuries of darkness and injustice, for the indios of the Americas.

=520  \\$aInspired by a chronicle of the Conquest of Mexico by Bernal Díaz del Castillo, this play tells the story of Gonzalo Guerrero and Jerónimo de Aguilar, two Spanish sailors who integrate themselves to a Mayan community after being captured and enslaved by the Mayans. After being freed due to their good behavior, Guerrero marries the daughter of the Mayan cacique and starts feeling like a Mayan himself. When Cortés arrives in Mexico, he tries to talk both sailors into joining his forces. Aguilar accepts this offer; Guerrero declines. War, negotiation and betrayal ensue, in a chain of events that underscores the atrocities surrounding the Conquest of America. This play highlights native Latin American values and traditions, as a part of TEC's continuous attempt to rescue the roots of Latin American identities. Teatro Experimental de Cali (TEC) is a collective of artists committed to the exploration and creation of new languages for Latin American theater. Founded in Colombia in 1955 by Enrique Buenaventura and a group of students at the Instituto Departamental de Bellas Artes, TEC has had a long and fruitful trajectory; their artistic and theoretical work has revolutionized the way that theater is conceived and practiced in Latin America. A key contribution to the field is their method of 'creación colectiva' ('collective creation'), in which all the participants of the play - including the audience - become involved with the dramatic text and its staging. In spite of this stress on collective work, TEC had in Enrique Buenaventura its main poet and playwright, who developed most of TEC's texts and directed the majority of their plays. While TEC's works address various historical and social issues, artistic quality is not sacrificed for the sake of political radicalism. TEC has thus created a theater that is politically and culturally engaged, poetic and innovative without losing its popular appeal.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of the first of a series of workshops conducted by members of Peruvian theater ensemble Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani in collaboration with local and international artists. The workshops, celebrated with children and youth of the Afro-Peruvian community of Guayabo (Chicha, Peru), were meant to explore and revalue the Afro-Peruvian cultural heritage through theater, plastic/visual arts, dance and music, in an effort to empower the community in the face of existing racism in the country, at a time when the African cultural influence and the Afro-Peruvian population was -and still is- looked down upon. Yuyachkani actress Ana Correa, director of the project, initiated this pedagogical and activist effort inspired by the exploration of Peruvian cultural diversity (including African influences in Peruvian music and dance) in Yuyachkani's renowned spectacle 'Músicos Ambulantes.' Peru's most important theater collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani (www.yuyachkani.org) has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. 'Yuyachkani' is a Quechua word that means 'I am thinking, I am remembering'; under this name, the theater group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru. The group is comprised of seven actors (Augusto Casafranca, Amiel Cayo, Ana Correa, Débora Correa, Rebeca Ralli, Teresa Ralli, and Julián Vargas), a technical designer (Fidel Melquíades), and an artistic director (Miguel Rubio), who have made a commitment to collective creation as a mode of theatrical production and to group theater as a life style. Their work has been among the most important in Latin America's so called 'New Popular Theater,' with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy. Yuyachkani won Peru's National Human Rights Award in 2000. Known for its creative embrace of both indigenous performance forms as well as cosmopolitan theatrical forms, Yuyachkani offers insight into Peruvian and Latin American theater, and to broader issues of postcolonial social aesthetics.

=520  \\$aMy Ugly Child tells the story of a displaced young Native American woman, drug and HIV sick, who comes to realize that all she knows about being Indian is through what she sees in popular culture, most notably in Hollywood films. On her journey to the Happy Hollywood Hunting Grounds, she meets stock Indian characters that promise to teach her how to be a real Hollywood Indian. This performance was developed by the American Indian Youth Theater Project (a part of the American Indian Youth Council) with special assistance from Karen Soto, and was written and directed by Steve Elm. Steve Elm (Oneida), editor of AMERINDA's Talking Stick Native Arts Quarterly, has worked in the arts on both sides of the Atlantic. Trained at London's Rose Bruford College, Steve has appeared as an actor in film, television and on the stage. He has worked as a playwright and director with London's Common Body Theatre, University of Manchester (England), the American Indian Community House Youth Theatre Project, and was a founding member of Chuka Lokoli Native Theatre Ensemble in New York City. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city. AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto neighborhood serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area. The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICHs Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICHs visual and performing arts department programs. Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badgers Corner.

=520  \\$aA rare interview with Bob Flanagan and Sheree Rose conducted by Franklin Furnace Founding Director Martha Wilson and her partner, Vince Bruns. Set in the exhibit Visiting Hours: An Installation by Bob Flanagan in collaboration with Sheree Rose at the New Museum, the interview details the duo’s performance art practice. Throughout, Flanagan and Rose discuss the sexual politics of art; pain as an art medium; the gaze of receiving and witnessing pain; art as an erotic gesture; and the spiritual in art. These topics are further discussed in the larger context of performance art history, referencing the erotic work of Ron Athey and Annie Sprinkle in relationship to Flanagan’s performances with Rose.
=520  \\$aBob Flanagan and Sheree Rose began their artistic collaboration in the late 1980’s Los Angeles club and art scenes. Their performance, photography, and video work integrates elements of BDSM, which culminated in the exhibit ‘Visiting Hours’ at the Santa Monica Museum of Art and at the New Museum. After Flanagan’s death to cystic fibrosis in 1996, Rose continued to make artwork honoring Flanagan’s legacy and their collaboration. Rose made contributions to the documentary, ‘Sick: The Life and Death of Bob Flanagan, Supermasochist,’ which premiered at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival and was awarded a Special Jury Prize. She was commissioned by Japan to produce ‘Boballoon,’ a 20-foot inflatable statue of Flanagan that was exhibited at Big Space in Tokyo. Rose shows her photography at international galleries, including the Coagula in Los Angeles, Tate Modern in Liverpool, and Jeu de Paume in Paris, and has presented multiple performances at Highways Performance Space and Gallery in Santa Monica. Long after Flanagan’s death, his artwork with Rose continues to be a model for artists dealing with illness and death.

=520  \\$aThe play deals with one of Colombia's most excruciating problems: social exclusion and its effects on everyday life. The characters in this play are all urban outcasts: homeless, prostitutes, beggars, etc. They are trying to build bridges to the larger community through participation in a theater group. The group wants to do a rendition of García Márquez's 'Crónica de una muerte anunciada'. The difficulties and tensions that arise around this project underline the extreme character of their exclusion, by-product of the abject poverty and lack of opportunities they experience in a society dismembered by class fragmentation and inequalities. At the end, the place where they were rehearsing is shut down and one of them is killed. The project, too, had a 'foretold death'. The play is part of La Calendaria's exploration of non verbal languages as means of dramatic expression; it also marks the beginning of the collaboration with urban poor and the organizations trying to help them. La Candelaria (www.teatrolacandelaria.org.co) was founded in 1966 by a group of independent artists and intellectuals from Colombia's experimental theater and cultural realm. Directed by Santiago García, La Candelaria is one of Colombian theater's most innovative agents, modernizing national drama while addressing popular audiences. By means of an ongoing exploration of national folklore, situations and characters, they have created some of Colombia's most compelling plays, some of them through the method of 'creación colectiva' ('collective creation'), addressing the acute social and political problems of their society. At the same time, they fostered the creation of Corporación Colombiana del Teatro and have developed a number of theoretical works that reflect upon dramatic creation, its methods and languages. Still nowadays, La Candelaria is committed to repertoire, experimentation, and discussion as fundamental elements to artistic creation.

=520  \\$aBased in Porto Alegre, The Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz was born in 1978 out of a desire for a radical renovation of the language of theatre. During the several years of their existence, they have created a personal aesthetics founded upon the authorial work of the actor, both on the stage and on the streets. Their venue, the Terreira da Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, works as a community theatre school, offering several free workshops open to the public. Their tribal organization is based on the principle of collective work, both in the creative process and in the maintenance of the space. For Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, theater is an instrument for both revealing and analyzing reality, and it's function is social: to contribute to the collective knowledge and to the improvement of the quality of life of the people. In a world marked by exclusion, marginalization, homogenization, by dehumanizing and barbaric efforts, they see it as their moral imperative to denounce injustice, sold opinions, authoritarianism, mediocrity and the erasing of memory. Ói Nóis sees theatre as an art of resistance, in the service of arts and politics, an art that does not fit the market patterns for ethics and aesthetics. Instead, they see theater as a way of life and as a vehicle for ideas: a theater that does not comment on life, but that takes part in it.
=520  \\$aThis staging of Goethe's Faust recreates one of the most universal esoteric myths of all times, that of the man who sells his soul to the devil. The entire story of Faust is staged, but not the whole text nor all the scenes. Instead, the audience of 30 people is guided through a succession of dreamlike environments, in a journey towards the unconscious of the character. Ói Nóis' Faust brings up the question of who is, after all, the Faustian man of our time: is it the scientist and the politician, or the outsider, the one who contests the system? This story reveals to the audience two essential factors for human emancipation: the desire for knowledge and the pleasure principal, both crucial for fighting power and fueling revolutions.

=520  \\$aRitual spoken word performance by Guillermo Gómez-Peña and Roberto Sifuentes with Chicano journalist, author and musician Rubén Martínez, as a part of Adobe L.A. Interventions. An enigmatic living diorama of a 'Vato cultural specimen' is flanked by a border-crossing 'spoken word' tour de force, a staccato back-and-forth of poetry, word-play, political commentary, autobiographical material, and performative provocation. This intervention was performed in the context of the project 'Urban Revisions: Current Projects in the Public Realm', curated by the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, California, and later edited by Elizabeth A. T. Smith. La Pocha Nostra (www.pochanostra.com) is an ever-morphing trans-disciplinary arts organization, founded in 1993 by Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Roberto Sifuentes, and Nola Mariano in California. The objective was to formally conceptualize Gómez-Peña's collaborations with other performance artists. It provides a base (and forum) for a loose network of rebel artists from various disciplines, generations and ethnic backgrounds, whose common denominator is the desire to cross and erase dangerous borders between art and politics, practice and theory, artist and spectator. As of June 2006, members include performance artists Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Violeta Luna, Michelle Ceballos, and Roberto Sifuentes; curators Gabriela Salgado and Orlando Britto; and over thirty associates worldwide in countries such as Mexico, Spain, the UK, and Australia. Projects range from performance solos and duets to large-scale performance installations including video, photography, audio, and cyber-art. La Pocha collaborates across national borders, race, gender and generations. Their collaborative model functions both as an act of citizen diplomacy and as a means to create ephemeral communities of like-minded rebels. The basic premise of these collaborations is founded on an ideal: If we learn to cross borders on stage, we may learn how to do so in larger social spheres. La Pocha strives to eradicate myths of purity and dissolve borders surrounding culture, ethnicity, gender, language, and métier. These are radical acts.

This live satellite transmission, interrupting the nightly news in an act of guerrilla television, presented the artist as a post-NAFTA Cyber-Aztec pirate who commandeered a commercial TV signal from his underground 'Vato bunker', where virtual reality meets border art in a collage of footage ranging from home movies, excerpts of earlier Gómez-Peña performances, Mexican 'B' movies, etc. Radical politics, autobiographical material, 'reverse anthropology' and parodic traces of traditional media broadcasts comprise the content of this legendary video art piece; its finished product was later distributed by Video Data Bank.

=520  \\$aRudy Martin: A Celebration of Life, 1951-1993 is a biographical documentary short about Rudy Martins talent as lyricist/composer and his activism concerning Native issues. White Eagle and Pura Fe sing several of Martin's songs; interspaced between the music are Martins lyrical explanations and family photos. Rudy Martin (1951-1993), a Tewa/Navajo/Apache Indian from New Mexico was a talented lyricist, singer, and musician who was committed to educating the non-Indian public about Indians on and off the reservation. Martin worked as the public relations director for the American Indian Community House (AICH) in New York City. He also served as a character consultant for PBS's children's television series Shining Time Station and earned his master of Fine Arts degree from New York Universitys Tisch School of The Arts. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city. AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto neighborhood serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area. The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICHs Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICHs visual and performing arts department programs. Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badgers Corner.

=520  \\$aVoices from the Criss-Cross Bridge is a one-woman piece, developed by Lisa Mayo. Mayo describes Voices as being 'a piece about the different parts of our lives that criss-cross and sometimes require healing.' The performance is based on her personal experiences of being a part of a family that belonged to two different Native nations and her attempts to make herself whole. With Voices, Mayo conveys the need for Indian Country to mend the cracks caused by familial fracturesand often the cause of conflict within families, communities and between nations. The performance eventually became Daughters from the Stars, featuring Spiderwoman Theater. Lisa Mayo, (Kuna/Rappahannock) was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. Mayo is co-founder of Spiderwoman Theater, which is the longest running Native women's theater troupe in the country. She studied at the New York School of Music, is a classically trained mezzo-soprano and studied under Uta Hagen.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of Circus Amok's show, 'NY: Ground Under,' performed in 1994 in diverse New York City parks, squares and other public spaces. The piece revolves around political, social and economic issues at play in NYC, posing a critique of the disconnect between the needs of the diverse, multitudinous population of NY vis-à-vis oppressive governmental policies impacting the city. The skits highlight the ethnic diversity of its population, while alluding to controversial budget cuts and public transportation campaigns, ineffective bureaucracy, oppressive policies regarding minorities, the pervasive presence of police forces in the public sphere, and issues of public health and environmental concerns related to waste management policies. Exposing controversial policies while educating and entertaining the audience, this piece is a call for civic action framed in a joyful extravaganza of acrobatic artistry, satiric skill, and good old-fashioned circus fun. Circus Amok (www.circusamok.org) is a New York City based circus-theater company whose mission is to provide free public art addressing contemporary issues of social justice to the people of New York City. Directed and founded by Jennifer Miller, the group has been together since 1989 bringing its funny, queer, caustic and sexy, political one-ring spectacles to diverse neighborhoods throughout the city. Over the years the traditional circus skills - tight rope walking, juggling, acrobatics, stilt walking, clowning - have been combined with experimental dance, lifesize puppetry, music old and new, and gender-bending performance art and improvisational techniques, creating new meanings for circus while continuing to entertain the crowds of all ages throughout the city streets, gardens, parks, and playgrounds, inviting the audience to join them in envisioning a more empowered life of community interaction while enjoying a queer celebratory spectacle.

=520  \\$aTim Miller is an internationally acclaimed performance artist. Miller's creative work as a performer and writer explores the artistic, spiritual and political topography of his identity as a gay man. Miller's performances have been presented all over North America, Australia, and Europe in such prestigious venues as Yale Repertory Theatre, the Institute of Contemporary Art (London), the Walker Art Center (Minneapolis), and the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Miller’s most recent book 1001 BEDS, an anthology of his performances, essays and journals, was published by University of Wisconsin Press in 2006. Miller has taught performance at UCLA, NYU, the School of Theology at Claremont and at universities all over the US. He is a co-founder of two of the most influential performance spaces in the United States: Performance Space 122 on Manhattan's Lower East Side and Highways Performance Space in Santa Monica, CA. After a nine-year stint in New York City, in 1987 Miller returned home to Los Angeles, California where he was born and raised. He currently lives there with his partner Alistair in Venice Beach.
=520  \\$aThe sound and physicality of breath comes to the forefront when sexual climax, life, and death intertwine. Presenting vignettes of life, love, suffering, and humor, Tim Miller offers a compelling storytelling about his own life in NYC in the 80s, signaling breathing as life assurance in a moment when the AIDS epidemic and the work with ACT UP dwelled in-between survival and disappearance. This solo piece emerged from Miller's aesthetic ambition to mirror gay society's cultural conflicts while ‘trying to find an artistic, spiritual and political response to the AIDS crisis.’ ‘Do it like your life depends on it,’ Miller declares, breathing rhythmically and deeply, ‘which it does. In and out. Breathe. Breathe out the lie that we don't belong together. Breathe in the love. Run naked through the streets of L.A. Proclaim the end of sadness. Celebrate the miracle of us.’ Song and water make the body vulnerable and strong at the same time, in connection with all those that might be dead but not really gone.

=520  \\$a‘Sheila’s Day,’ written by Duma Ndlovu, and directed by Roberta Uno, explores the troubled race relations between white employers and black domestic employees, and the many layers within structures of power – ‘Sheila’ is the name that the rich ladies use to call their household employees, because they claim that they cannot remember the women’s names. Every Thursday is ‘Sheila’s Day,’ when the domestic workers have a day off, and the women come to meet with each other. During these meetings, it is possible to learn these women’s desires and hopes, and their belief that ‘women have the power to change the world.’ They empower themselves through music and songs that function as oral history and political language, and their dance as a means of communication and political resistance, conveying a strong affirmation of being a ‘woman’ and ‘black,’ thus a ‘black woman.’ They find strength through each other in their collective struggle for freedom - song, dance, and prayer play an important part in their bonding with one another, and this closeness is performed through voices and bodies. This video documentation also features pre-performance exercises.
=520  \\$aFrom 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a ‘new world’ - one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting demographics. From a geographic ‘outpost’ in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, methods, and production. One of New WORLD Theater’s artistic legacies is Project 2050, an early call to imagine the U.S. demographic shift, with people of the future - youth, in equal collaboration with artists and scholars.

=520  \\$a'Bocas de bolero' is a collective creation by Teatro La Máscara on the relationships women have with everyday activities in the domestic realm. The melodrama of marriage, the notion of waiting, domestic chores, religion, mother-daughter relationships, gender conventions, etc., are woven with the romantic and melancholy sounds and themes of bolero. Through a polysemic treatment of space, reiteration, movement and image that explores the dynamics of memory, personal present and collective past, the performance artfully confronts the taboos, conventions and struggles surrounding cultural notions of gender. Teatro La Máscara is the oldest - and one of the only - feminist, all-women's theater in Colombia. Founded in 1972 in Cali, La Máscara was a political theater initially comprised of male as well as female actors; by the early 1980s, when only the women stayed and wanted to continue the theatrical trajectory of the group, Lucy Bolaños decided to make La Máscara a women's ensemble fully dedicated to a feminine dramaturgy on gender issues. Committed to feminism and social change, they have stayed true to this mission, despite the many social and economic pressures they've had to endure in an environment plagued by violence and machismo, which constantly seeks to 'invisibilize' their work. Because of their fruitful stubbornness, La Máscara is not only creating and staging plays, but also working with marginalized communities, actively participating in political protests and demonstrations, and being involved in the organization of theater festivals. Through their work, they keep re-thinking women's role in the construction of a peaceful Colombia.

=520  \\$aIn this Eugenia León cabaret concert, performed at Teatro Bar El Hábito, Alfred Hitchcock (played by Alejandro Calva) narrates a 'Private Eye' story, a duel of wits between a Mexican diva-cum-exceptional detective (León) and her archenemy, Jack 'El Declamador' (or 'Jack, the Declamator,' played by Jesusa Rodríguez). Singing well-know romantic songs ('Envidia,' 'Perfidia,' 'Frenesí,' 'La tirana,' 'Lo mismo que usted,' 'Piel Canela,' and 'Quizá, quizá, quizá,' among others), León must save 137 kidnapped children from Jack's affected declamation of Latin American Modernist poetry, while contesting the villain's request for support to his candidate to the upcoming Mexican presidential elections: Paco Stanley, a popular Mexican declamator. In order to save the day, León has to solve the mystery proposed by the villain: to figure out the identity of the alleged murderer of Marilyn Monroe (also played by Rodríguez)... 
=520  \\$ain 10 minutes! With the help of her boleros and the study of 'some documents,' the detective concludes that Hitchcock is Monroe's assassin, and proceeds to arrest him. Thankful for solving the mystery, Marilyn shares with Eugenia her secret technique for achieving her famous 'floating white dress effect'... After solving the enigma, León and Jack clash in a deadly duel of wits, until the 'Musa Inspiradora' (or 'Inspirational Muse', also played by Calva) gets in their way. Improvised insults, tricky moves, and phone calls from the Presidential House all contribute to León's victory and to Jack's escape. The Muse takes sides with the detective and promises to inspire her to sing 'like a goddess'... concluding a magnificent concert, that inspired an 'encore' request by Eugenia's eager audience. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodréguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico.   
=520  \\$aOften referred to as a chameleon, Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her espectáculos (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and carpa, to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguezs energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s.   
=520  \\$aShe left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: I am going to die with that woman. Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor.   
=520  \\$aIn this off-off space, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas, Jesusa y Liliana have produced hundreds of shows since the 1980s.

=520  \\$a'Fábulas del Caribe' is a modern day account of how the Caribbean islands were created and later populated. This musical theater production provides a voyage through ancient mythologies of the Taíno people. Set to original music, the show brings to the stage the magical deities who whimsically create water, earth, wind and fire. The stories/myths include Marou and Boinayel (the Sun and the Moon), Yaya and Yayael (personifications of the beginning of time), and Deminán Caracaracol (the mischief maker) and his three identical brothers, who accidentally tip a gourd and fill the ocean basins with water and fish. Founded in 1979 and based in The Bronx, New York City, Pregones Theater (http://www.pregones.org) has performed in more than 400 cities and 13 countries. The company enjoys citywide recognition for their lasting contributions to the performing arts field and are recipients of numerous distinctions including current Leading National Ensemble Theatre Designation from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Primary Cultural Institution Designation from the New York State Council on the Arts, the New York State Governors Arts Award, the Culture & Humanities Award from the Center for Puerto Rican Studies, numerous artist and production awards, as well as invitations to appear at international festivals and events. Over the years Pregones has developed a style that combines theater, music and movement, oral and written traditions, and a signature urban sensibility. The ensemble draws from popular Puerto Rican artistic expressions and literature to create and stage its work. Today, Pregones has grown to be one of the leading Puerto Rican/Latino theater theaters in the United States. From migrations to indigenous mythologies to subway stories, the companys repertoire covers a growing sample of Latino experiences and identities.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of Hasta Cuándo Corazón, theater piece by Peruvian Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani. In this play, a series of characters of diverse backgrounds live together in a project in the middle of the city, from which they are soon to be evicted. Even though they are neighbors facing a common fate, the characters await isolated from one another instead of forging a network of solidarity in the face of the eviction. Each life story is told and retold individually, recreated by physical actions in a reiterative play that evidences the profound and painful dissociation between word and action in these characters lives. Perus most important theatre collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani (www.yuyachkani.org) has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. Yuyachkani is a Quechua word that means I am thinking, I am remembering; under this name, the theatre group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru. The group is comprised of seven actors (Augusto Casafranca, Amiel Cayo, Ana Correa, Débora Correa, Rebeca Ralli, Teresa Ralli, and Julián Vargas), a technical designer (Fidel Melquíades), and an artistic director (Miguel Rubio), who have made a commitment to collective creation as a mode of theatrical production and to group theatre as a life style. Their work has been among the most important in Latin Americas so called New Popular Theatre, with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy. Yuyachkani won Perus National Human Rights Award in 2000. Known for its creative embrace of both indigenous performance forms as well as cosmopolitan theatrical forms, Yuyachkani offers insight into Peruvian and Latin American theatre, and to broader issues of postcolonial social aesthetics.

=520  \\$aRichard Schechner's East Coast Artists bring this foundational Western myth forward to the end of the 20th century with Faust as a cook-alchemist. Food preparation and consumption is the ruling metaphor for the destructive appetites of Western expansion culminating in both the Nazi crime of genocide and the post-industrial excesses of globalization and genetic manipulation. Schechner and his colleagues rework the story. Mephistopheles played by a woman dressed as a man but not disguising her 'actual' gender is assisted by Hitler, also played by a woman. Part One of 'Faust/gastronome' draws heavily on Goethe, tracing Faust's seduction of Gretchen (aided by Mephistopheles) and his abandoning her to her death. A considerable portion of the dialogue is Goethe's, performed in German. Part Two Schechner describes as a 'tragedy of development.' Here Faust heads the 'Fist Group' of corporations involved in genetic engineering and global exploitation. 
=520  \\$aJust before his death and damnation, Faust meets Gretchen who has come to seek him out and help bring him to hell. At one point, Hitler's architect, Albert Speer, appears on a talk show justifying World War II and the Holocaust. Later, Faust and a neo-Nazi teenage appear on the same show. The set features three sturdy wooden tables used in many configurations to contain the action. On a platform upstage, composer Ralph Denzer leads a small jazz ensemble. Richard Schechner is a theater director, performance theorist and university professor known for being one of the founders of the academic discipline of Performance Studies at Tisch School of the Arts, New York University. Schechner combines his work in anthropology with innovative approaches to performance of all kinds including ritual, drama, environmental theater, political rallies, dance, music, etc.   
=520  \\$ain order to consider how performance can be understood not just as an object of study, but also as an active intellectual-artistic practice. He is the editor of 'TDR: The Journal of Performance Studies.' His books include 'Environmental Theater,' 'The Future of Ritual,' 'Performance Theory,' 'Between Theater and Anthropology' and 'Performance Studies: An Introduction.' As of 2007, his books have been translated into 14 languages.

=520  \\$aSince 1981, the Split Britches Company (founded by Lois Weaver, Peggy Shaw, and Deb Margolin, www.splitbritches.com) has written and performed in trio, duet, and solo, as well as collaborated and performed with other artists. They describe their work in this way: 'Our work is rooted in popular culture, but positioned against it. It relies on moments rather than plot, relationships rather than story. It depends on the surprise of transformation rather than the logic of psychological narrative. It straddles the line between performance and theater, exploiting theatricality while exposing the pretense. It is about a community of outsiders, queers, eccentrics. It is feminist because it encourages the imaginative potential in everyone and lesbian because it takes the presence of lesbian on stage as a given.' Their vaudevillian satirical gender-bending performances have received numerous awards, including a Jane Chamber award and four Village Voice OBIE awards. Their collection of scripts, 'Split Britches Feminist Performance/Lesbian Practice', edited by Sue Ellen Case, won the 1997 Lambda Literary Award for Drama. This video documents Peggy Shaw's one-woman show 'You're Just Like My Father.' In this performance Shaw pieces together the challenges of growing up butch in the 1950's with a combination of both toughness and vulnerability. Using male role models such as an Army officer and Elvis, Shaw explores the controversial relationship between a butch and her mother, offering both affirmation and criticism. If on the surface 'You're Just Like My Father' seems to be a wry exercise in pseudo-macho braggadoccio, it has its poignant undercurrents. Shaw's performance isn't so much a satire of male chauvinism as a pure celebration of her masculine self.

=520  \\$aIsvael: Native American Fetishes was written, directed, and performed by Chan, a.k.a. Anthony Spotten. Chan evokes the power ascribed to animal fetishes through his dance and fashion designs. His performance was conceived in conjunction with an American Indian Community House Gallery exhibition, curated by Lloyd Oxendine, which focused on Native American fetishes and their importance in the lives of Native people. A fetish is an animal usually carved out of stone or shell that is said to house the spirit or supernatural qualities of the animal. Animal fetishes are used by different American Indian tribes in prayer and ceremonies, and as talisman and amulets for successful hunting and fishing, procreation, agriculture, health, protection of the young and long life. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city. AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto neighborhood serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area. The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICHs Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICHs visual and performing arts department programs. Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badgers Corner. Indian Summer is an annual event at AICH and an occasion for artists to present their latest works to the community and the general public. All performers, whether new to the field or veteran practitioners, are encouraged to present their work.

They describe their work in this way: 'Our work is rooted in popular culture, but positioned against it. It relies on moments rather than plot, relationships rather than story. It depends on the surprise of transformation rather than the logic of psychological narrative. It straddles the line between performance and theater, exploiting theatricality while exposing the pretense. It is about a community of outsiders, queers, eccentrics. It is feminist because it encourages the imaginative potential in everyone and lesbian because it takes the presence of lesbian on stage as a given'. Their vaudevillian satirical gender-bending performances have received numerous awards, including a Jane Chamber award and four Village Voice OBIE awards. Their collection of scripts, 'Split Britches Feminist Performance/Lesbian Practice', edited by Sue Ellen Case, won the 1997 Lambda Literary Award for Drama. This video documents their show 'Lesbians Who Kill', written by Deb Margolin in collaboration with Peggy Shaw and Lois Weaver. Performed by Shaw and Weaver as characters May and June, a couple who go very 'wrong', the play looks at what might motivate women and lesbians in particular to become killers and serial ones at that.

=520  \\$a'Luna menguante' poses a theatrical immersion into women's 'intimate and secret' universe. Meshing religious and popular myths, rites, and beliefs, along with music and circus skills, four women of different generations (grandmother, mother, and two daughters) weave a complex fabric of taboos and desires around natural and biological processes - menstruation, deflowering, menopause, senile dementia. Bound by repression and inhibitions, the characters inhabit real and mental spaces in a sordid world dictated by habits and traditions. Teatro La Máscara is the oldest - and one of the only - feminist, all-women's theater in Colombia. Founded in 1972 in Cali, La Máscara was a political theater initially comprised of male as well as female actors; by the early 1980s, when only the women stayed and wanted to continue the theatrical trajectory of the group, Lucy Bolaños decided to make La Máscara a women's ensemble fully dedicated to a feminine dramaturgy on gender issues. Committed to feminism and social change, they have stayed true to this mission, despite the many social and economic pressures they've had to endure in an environment plagued by violence and machismo, which constantly seeks to 'invisibilize' their work. Because of their fruitful stubbornness, La Máscara is not only creating and staging plays, but also working with marginalized communities, actively participating in political protests and demonstrations, and being involved in the organization of theater festivals. Through their work, they keep re-thinking women's role in the construction of a peaceful Colombia.

=520  \\$a'Baile Cangrejero' is a musical/theater spectacle in celebration of Afro-Latino poetry, music and dance. The writers featured in the production are internationally recognized as some of the major poets of Afro-Latino literature. Through their work they have given eloquent artistic voices to the experiences, struggles, joys and pride of people of African descent in the Americas. The production centers around a fictitious poet named Nicolás, portrayed by award winning actor Jorge B. Merced, who takes the audience on a journey in search of his true surname; that of a Mestizo. To the popular rhythms of bomba and plena, Merced is accompanied by Judith Rivera on vocals and narration and guest stars Los Pleneros de la 21. Founded in 1979 and based in The Bronx, New York City, Pregones Theater (http://www.pregones.org) has performed in more than 400 cities and 13 countries. The company enjoys citywide recognition for their lasting contributions to the performing arts field and are recipients of numerous distinctions including current Leading National Ensemble Theatre Designation from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Primary Cultural Institution Designation from the New York State Council on the Arts, the New York State Governor's Arts Award, the Culture & Humanities Award from the Center for Puerto Rican Studies, numerous artist and production awards, as well as invitations to appear at international festivals and events. Over the years Pregones has developed a style that combines theater, music and movement, oral and written traditions, and a signature urban sensibility. The ensemble draws from popular Puerto Rican artistic expressions and literature to create and stage its work. Today, Pregones has grown to be one of the leading Puerto Rican/Latino theater theaters in the United States. From migrations to indigenous mythologies to subway stories, the company's repertoire covers a growing sample of Latino experiences and identities.

=520  \\$aFounded in 1965 by Luis Valdez, El Teatro Campesino was initially the cultural wing of the United Farm Workers union in California's central valley. With a pointed political mission, ETC performed their actos in the fields, agitprop improvisations communicated eloquently with the workers, who could neither read nor write, but recognized themselves and their values in the actos. By 1970 ETC had gained an international reputation, with major contributions to Chicano culture in the U.S. and to the development and expansion of the boundaries of theater everywhere. Theirs is a popular theater rooted in the American streets, early California history, Mayan/Aztec mythology and Mexican folklore and spiritualism, all geared toward expression of social, political and cultural perceptions. This video documents the piece La Pastorela, which is performed biannually by El Teatro Campesino during the Christmas holidays, alternating with La Virgen del Tepeyac, in the historic Mission of San Juan Bautista, established in 1797. Pastorelas, or Shepherds Plays, originated in medieval Europe as religious dramas and were later brought to the new world and Alta California by the Spanish missionaries. La Pastorela recreates the long trek of those first pastores to the holy site of the Nativity. This adaptation of La Pastorela was originally created in 1975, under the direction of Luis Valdez, based on a traditional version from San Luis Potosi in Mexico. The Lucifer character of Luzbel and his demons attempt to thwart the shepherds from reaching Bethlehem and the Holy Manger. However, in a dynamic clash of good against evil, San Miguel, the Archangel, and an army of angels overpower the demonic powers of Luzbel and the shepherds are at last free to complete their journey. This particular production, staged in 1995 by Kinan Valdez, is a youthful and vibrant reincarnation of this ETC popular classic.

=520  \\$a‘Flying West,’ written by Pearl Cleage and directed by Roberta Uno, is the story of a small group of African-American women whose lives changed when they decide to go to the West and settle in a new, rough region. In this encounter with a new environment, themes such as determination, racism, interracial marriage, feminism, pride, and freedom arise to offer a reflection upon how individuals, families, and communities survive together. Among the difficulties of everyday life, there is power in the fact of being able of knowing who we are and where we go, as the women in the play affirm their identity as ‘three Negro women.’ The sisters Sophie, Fannie, and Minnie, and their neighbor Miss Leah, have to empower each other, especially when Minnie suffers domestic violence from her husband. When the couple’s abusive relationship becomes more and more violent, and when this violence threatens all the women’s well-being, they have to decide how to maintain their freedom and their sisterhood. This video documentation also features a pre-performance discussion with the cast.
=520  \\$aFrom 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a ‘new world’ - one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting demographics. From a geographic ‘outpost’ in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, methods, and production. One of New WORLD Theater’s artistic legacies is Project 2050, an early call to imagine the U.S. demographic shift, with people of the future - youth, in equal collaboration with artists and scholars.

Elvira and Hortencia Colorado, Chichimec Otomi storytellers, playwrights, performers and community activists are founding members of Coatlicue Theatre Company (www.coatlicue.com). They are also members of Danza Mexica Cetiliztli, New York Zapatistas and the American Indian Community House. The company's plays address social, political, cultural and identity issues that impact their lives and their community. Their work is based on stories they weave together which educate as well as entertain, while reaffirming their survival as urban Native American women. They have conducted storytelling/ theatre workshops. They are recipients of the Ingrid Washinawatok Community Activism Award. 
=520  \\$aAlso featured is 'In the Spirit,' written and performed by the Chuka Lokoli Theater Company ('Chuka Lokoli' means community spirit in Choctaw). A group of Indians are planning to blow-up Mt. Rushmore and while at the site their own personal issues threaten to derail their plan. The Mt. Rushmore monument is located in the sacred site of the Black Hills South Dakota. The presence of the president's heads in the Black Hills is a site of contention, as they are seen as defacing sacred territory. Furthermore, federal law protects Mt. Rushmore from defacement by rock-climbers and other sportsman, while sites such as Mato Tipi (devil's tower), which are sacred to the surrounding tribes, are afforded no such protection. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city.   
=520  \\$aAICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto 'neighborhood' serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area. The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICH's Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980's, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICH's visual and performing arts department programs.   
=520  \\$aTaking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badger's Corner. 'Indian Summer' is an annual event at AICH and an occasion for artists to present their latest works to the community and the general public. All performers, whether new to the field or veteran practitioners, are encouraged to present their work.

=520  \\$aBased on Aeschylus' Oresteia, Mapa Teatro's 'Orestea Ex Machina' presents a world where gods don't come down to earth to solve humanity's conflicts and contradictions. Their divine absence, the empty space left by them, is the ground from where this rendition questions Aeschylus' piece and where Mapa Teatro installs a symbolic machinery of death, vengeance and justice - machinery already envisioned by the Tragic poets - in order to tell humanity, across time and space, about the dynamics of life and history. One of the foremost artistic companies in Colombia, Mapa Teatro (www.mapateatro.org) has been producing theater, performance and art installation projects since 1984. Founders and directors, Rolf and Heidi Abderhalden have created a wide ranging repertoire of theater, opera, mixed-media performance, and site-specific installation. Their work proposes richly textured visual metaphors in which they consider often complex psychological, social and political relationships. Committed to experimentation, and less interested in the actor as an 'agent of fiction,' they describe their project as 'a laboratory of social imagination,' that offers a space for presenting community issues and human concerns in media and performance. This combination of real-life situations and sites along with highly stylized aesthetic staging produces a tension between real action and (re)presentation. Mapa Teatro draws from live events captured on video such as the demolition of a neighborhood in Bogotá, ritual practice, and texts that explore the relationship of postmodern subjects, myth and metaphor. Mapa Teatro has performed by commissions, festivals and collaborative projects world-wide.

=520  \\$aIndian 101 is a dark comedy about a class of Indians with literary aspirations. Set in an adult writing class a few days before Christmas, the students decide to have class as usual despite the teacher's absence. The result is both hilarious and tragic as the critique of work soon degrades into criticism of each other and ends in all out war. Indian 101 was written by the Fourplay Theater Company. Director Steve Elm, formally a Fourplay Company member, later adapted Indian 101 for the American Indian Youth Theater Project. The Theater Project is a part of the American Indian Community House Youth Council, which serves as a cultural and social outlet for Native American Youth concerned with current issues facing the Native community. Following the play is a performance by two members of the a capella womens group Ulali (Pura Fe and Soni Moreno). Steve Elm (Oneida), editor of AMERINDA's Talking Stick Native Arts Quarterly, has worked in the arts on both sides of the Atlantic. 
=520  \\$aTrained at London's Rose Bruford College, Steve has appeared as an actor in film, television and on the stage. He has worked as a playwright and director with London's Common Body Theatre, University of Manchester (England), the American Indian Community House Youth Theatre Project, and was a founding member of Chuka Lokoli Native Theatre Ensemble in New York City. Ulali, formerly known as Pura Fe (a seven member group) is an a cappella women's trio that features Pura Fe (Tuscarora), Soni Moreno (Apache/Mayan) and Jennifer Kreisberg (Tuscarora). Ulali blends a variety of traditional and contemporary indigenous music of the Americas and incorporate political, social and personal issues affecting all human beings. This evening only two members Pura and Soni perform a set of their own songs.

=520  \\$aTeresa Hernández is a Puerto Rican stage artist. Teresas creative projects are characterized by a consistent eschewing of traditional artistic categories. Teresas characters explore and expose the anxieties of everyday life in Puerto Rican society, transversally investigating issues of gender, class and race. Acceso controlado is a multimedia spectacle revolving around the theme of controlled access and the metaphor (and growing reality) of gated communities in Puerto Rico. Five sections comprise this piece, with five characters masterfully performed by Hernández. La Reina delivers a fascist, classist, racist speech, claiming that democratization and mestizaje are crimes against the historic order. The security guard Teniente Cortés talks about the paranoia and false security nets people resort to - controlling access through the now ubiquitous gated communities being one of them - in order to protect themselves form the alarming growth of criminality in Puerto Rico. We later find El Chamaco in Primera Plana, a scene exploring the body language and expressions of the criminal(ized) youth, bringing to the forefront the interplay between will and subjection, the criminal life on the street and the institutional forces trying to control it. A short film follows, titled Milagros Vélez, based on Request Concert by Franz Xaver Kroetz and Act without Words by Samuel Beckett. The last piece, La Primera Dama en Solo Operático en Tiempos Desafortunados completes the performance, with a hysterical First Lady symbolizing the banality of complaint in a society where a financial elite controls cultural expression and politicians hide corruption behind hypocritical civic concern.

=520  \\$a¿¡Qué Nuevas!? - What’s New!?, Latina Theatre Lab’s first Original Musical Comedy, examined stereotypes within the Entertainment Industry through the varied experiences of eleven Latina actresses. With Carmen Miranda as an icon, interwoven with video interviews of the performers, this work explores self-image, self-doubt, and finally self-acceptance by dropping the mask and singing 'Mamá yo quiero!'.
=520  \\$aLatina Theatre Lab was one of the first and only all-Latina collective of writers, performers, and directors in the U.S. Their performance-sketch work dealt with pop culture, immigration, cross-cultural identities, and the complexities of 'being Latina.' The group was founded in 1994 by four San Francisco Bay Area actresses known as the 'comadres': Dena Martinez, Jaime Lujan, Tessa Koning-Martinez and Wilma Bonet. Their purpose was to create theater that would go beyond the ever shrinking and limited range of roles for which Latina actresses were being considered. These roles were scarce, and rarely defied racial stereotypes. From 1994-1999, Latina Theatre Lab's work played with these cultural and gender stereotypes, exploring the legacies they inherited both as Latinas and as women. They also collaborated with fellow comedy troupes in California, such as Culture Clash, the Asian American Theater Company, and the 18 Mighty Mountain Warriors.

=520  \\$aVideo excerpts of "Son Corazón / Heartstrung", a theatrical tribute to actress and activist Myrna Vázquez, premiered at the Jorge Hernández Cultural Center in Villa Victoria, Boston, in July 1995, and later restaged at the U. of Amherst as a part of the New World Theatre in June 1996. The work, written and directed by former MIT artist-in-residence Rose Luisa Márquez, was researched and conceived in conjunction with the MIT Office of the Arts, IBA Arte y Cultura, Next Stage, Inc., and the Cambridge Multicultural Arts Center. This production was developed as a collaboration between Márquez, long-time collaborator Antonio Martorell, Assistant Professor of Theater Arts Brenda Cotto-Escalera, and professional performers Noelia Ortiz, Susan Thomson, Melinda López and Cati Lagniel. A bilingual, agile production, the piece pays homage to the outstanding theater, film, radio and television performances by Vázquez (born in Puerto Rico and "dying too soon" in Boston), as well as her commitment to social and political activism. The reenactment of some of her most memorable roles - with canonic Puerto Rican texts "La Carreta" and "La Pasión Según Antígona Pérez" - by means of objects, songs, coexisting languages and imaginative spatial articulations, reaches metatheatrical complexity while entrancing the audience with memories of "a heart that loved too much". Rosa Luisa Márquez (www.marquezmartorell.org) is a Puerto Rican theatre artist and pedagogue. Founding member of the theater group Anamú in 1971, she holds a masters degree from New York University and a Doctorate from Michigan State University; she specializes in contemporary theater. Rosa Luisa started her teaching career at the Theater department of the University of Puerto Rico in 1978. She developed the current curriculum of Drama Activities, which she teaches in her workshops at schools, prisons, rehab centers, womens shelters, nursing homes and community centers. Her directing projects include "Romeo(s) y Julieta(s)", "Historias para ser Contadas", "La Leyenda del Cemí", "Procesión", "Waiting for Godot", "Jardín de Pulpos", "Absurdos en Soledad", "El León y la Joya", among others. In conjunction with Puerto Rican visual artist Antonio Martorell, she created the concept of Itinerant Performers (1987-1990) resulting in twelve productions. Published books include "Brincos y saltos: el juego como disciplina teatral" and "Historias para ser contadas, montaje de Rosa Luisa Márquez". She is a member of the board of directors and pedagogical team for the EITALCs International School of Latin American and Caribbean Theater. Ongoing artistic collaborators include Gilda Navarra and Antonio Martorell (Puerto Rico), Grupo Malayerba (Ecuador), Grupo Yuyachkani (Peru), and directors Peter Shumann (Bread & Puppet Theater, U.S.A.) and Augusto Boal (Theater of the Oppressed, Brazil).

The piece is a ludic theatrical exploration of issues of gender, race, culture, imperialism, and social conditions in Puerto Rican everyday life as portrayed by short stories written by the most outstanding Puerto Rican writers in the '80s. Created collaboratively by the members of the Teatro Rodante, the piece weaves a varied array of themes, languages and styles in their staging of 'La crianza: con la boca es un mamey' by Kalman Barsy, 'Marina y su olor' by Mayra Santos, 'Hostos, bróder, esto está difícil' by Magali García Ramis, 'La Gurúa Talía: Correo de San Valentín' by Ana Lydia Vega, as well as unpublished texts by renowned Puerto Rican artist Antonio Martorell.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of Circus Amoks show, NY: Ground Under II, performed in 1995 in diverse NYC parks, squares and other public spaces. The piece revolves around political, social and economic issues at play in New York City, while posing a critique of the disconnect between the needs of the diverse, multitudinous population of NYC vis-à-vis oppressive governmental policies impacting the city. Skits include a 'short history of NY', highlighting the geopolitical diversity of the city, along with scenes alluding to controversial budget cuts, public transportation campaigns, etc. Satires of Republican political figures like Newt Gingrich (58th Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives), George Pataki (53rd Governor of New York), and Rudy Giuliani (Mayor of NYC at the time) place the piece in the context of contemporary issues affecting the citizens of NYC, exposing controversial policies while educating and entertaining the audience in a joyful extravaganza of acrobatic artistry, satiric skill, and good old-fashioned circus fun. Circus Amok (www.circusamok.org) is a New York City based circus-theater company whose mission is to provide free public art addressing contemporary issues of social justice to the people of New York City. Directed and founded by Jennifer Miller, the group has been together since 1989 bringing its funny, queer, caustic and sexy, political one-ring spectacles to diverse neighborhoods throughout the city. Over the years the traditional circus skills - tight rope walking, juggling, acrobatics, stilt walking, clowning- have been combined with experimental dance, lifesize puppetry, music old and new, and gender-bending performance art and improvisational techniques, creating new meanings for circus while continuing to entertain the crowds of all ages throughout the city streets, gardens, parks, and playgrounds, inviting the audience to join them in envisioning a more empowered life of community interaction while enjoying a queer celebratory spectacle.

They describe their work in this way: 'Our work is rooted in popular culture, but positioned against it. It relies on moments rather than plot, relationships rather than story. It depends on the surprise of transformation rather than the logic of psychological narrative. It straddles the line between performance and theater, exploiting theatricality while exposing the pretense. It is about a community of outsiders, queers, eccentrics. It is feminist because it encourages the imaginative potential in everyone and lesbian because it takes the presence of lesbian on stage as a given.' Their vaudevillian satirical gender-bending performances have received numerous awards, including a Jane Chamber award and four Village Voice OBIE awards. Their collection of scripts, 'Split Britches Feminist Performance/Lesbian Practice', edited by Sue Ellen Case, won the 1997 Lambda Literary Award for Drama. This video documents 'Lust and Comfort', a theater piece written by Peggy Shaw, Lois Weaver and James Neale Kennerely and performed by Peggy Shaw and Lois Weaver. 'Lust and Comfort' uses three story lines to examine the ups and downs of a long term relationship and the changing terrain of sexual desire. Using cross-dressing characters and movie references to 'The Servant' and 'The Bitter Tears of Petra Von Kant,' Shaw and Weaver address how lesbians invent their lives out of popular heterosexual cultural references.

GONA (Gathering of Native Americans) is a culturally specific guide for community healing and wellness. The four-day gathering provides a safe place the community to share, heal, and develop a plan of action for change and empowerment. The GONA offers hope, encouragement, and a positive basis for Native community action. Native communities are provided with a framework to examine historical trauma and its impact on substance abuse issues and a prevention framework based on values inherent in traditional Native cultures. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city. AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto neighborhood serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area. The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICHs Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICHs visual and performing arts department programs. Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badgers Corner.

The round dance shown here is an Iroquois social dance, which can be done both inside and outside the traditional longhouse. Tom Porter (Sakokwenionkwas, The One Who Wins) is the spokesman and Chief Spiritual Leader of the Mohawk Community of Kanatsiohareke (Ga na jó ha lay: gay) in Fonda, New York. A member of the Bear Clan, he was raised as part of the Akwesasne Mohawk Nation in upstate New York. Mr. Porter acted as Bear Clan Chief in the traditional longhouse movement, opposite the state-sanctioned Tribal Council. He has served numerous positions on the Mohawk Nation of Chiefs Council for over 25 years.

=520  \\$aRoughly edited video documentation of cabaret performance by renowned artists Jesusa Rodríguez and Liliana Felipe. 'Juicio a Salinas', a mock trial of former Mexican president Carlos Salinas de Gortari (president of Mexico from 1988 to 1994) at the Teatro Bar El Hábito, is an invitation to civic society to participate in a broader national call for accountability to the Mexican government in the face of charges of corruption, electoral fraud, embezzlement, and political violence. Using humor and improvisation as a tool for starting a public dialogue, the artists invite the audience to participate as a theatrical jury of deputies; in this guise, the public has the opportunity to directly question 'Salinas' (played by a cross-dressed Rodríguez) and ultimately pass judgment on him, deciding whether or not to send him to the Almoloya penitentiary. Among protest chants of 'El pueblo apoya, Salinas a Almoloya' ('The people claim it, (send) Salinas to Alomloya') and the song 'Solidaridad' ('propaganda theme song for Salinas' controversial Programa Nacional de Solidaridad, PRONASOL), the piece is proposed as a performative 'propitiatory ritual' for political justice, rehearsing civic participation in Mexico's public sphere. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodréguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a chameleon, Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her espectáculos (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and carpa, to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguezs energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: I am going to die with that woman. Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. In this off-off space, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas, Jesusa y Liliana have produced hundreds of shows since the 1980s.

=520  \\$aVideo documentary celebrating the 5th anniversary of Teatro-Bar El Hábito. Its founders, Jesusa Rodríguez and Liliana Felipe, created this queer 'mockumentary' as a parodic pseudo-ethnographic study of their renowned venue in Mexico City. Tracing its roots to the tradition of German cabaret and analyzing the queer nuances of their creative work, the 'Patronas' thread footage from memorable performances performed at El Hábito: 'El Primer Fracaso,' 'Cachirulo para Adultos,' 'Homenaje a Cri-Cri,' and 'Juicio a Salinas,' to name just a few. The ongoing voice-over commentary mocks the ultra-conservative view many Mexicans have of Rodríguez & Felipe's ground-breaking work, considered a 'perverse' influence on Catholic, right-wing conservative values and traditions. This retrospective is a testimony both to the trajectory and prolific work of Rodríguez and Felipe, and to the kind of space El Hábito is: a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodríguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a 'chameleon,' Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her 'espectáculos' (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and 'carpa,' to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguez's energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s.

There is another edition of the performace (where the action jumps from one moment of the show to a later one) in 1:02:02, with no visible break in the tape flow.

=520  \\$aJesusa Rodríguez acts the role of Mexican Baroque poet Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz (1648-1695), here supposedly jailed in Mexico's Almoloya high security prison in year 2000. In an anachronistic space that interweaves the 17th and the 20th centuries, Sor Juana writes a letter to the press condemning the corruption of Carlos Salinas de Gortari's presidency. Brilliantly parodying Sor Juana's sonnets, Rodríguez develops a hilarious plot of transvestite lawyers, lesbian love, malfunctioning computers, and sushi rolls, to critique the state's use of censorship and persecution to silence any voices of dissent. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodréguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a chameleon, Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her espectáculos (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and carpa, to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguezs energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: I am going to die with that woman. Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. In this off-off space, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas, Jesusa y Liliana have produced hundreds of shows since the 1980s.

=520  \\$aCollective theater creation by Peruvian Grupo Cultural Yuyahckani, based on texts by Latin American and Peruvian writers who have written poetically about love and human relationshipssuch as Rafael Cárdenas (Venezuela), Eduardo Galeano (Uruguay), and Manuel Scorza (Peru). The play is weaved around two words: Love and Utopia--be it the Utopia of Love or the Love for Utopia. A long-time couple kills time by putting themselves in extreme situations in order to overcome boredom and safeguard their love. They leave home and wander from run-down hotel to run-down hotel, confronting every day as if it was their very first. This piece is an exploration on the world of romantic couples, an investigation on love, encounters and disencounters, communication and miscommunication, presence and absence. Far from portraying a linear storyline, it shows a broad spectrum of sensations and relationships for and with the spectators, so that it is them who ultimately piece together the elements at play through the lens of their own experiences and references regarding love, human relations, solitude, solidarity, disenchantment and hope. Perus most important theater collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani (www.yuyachkani.org) has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. Yuyachkani is a Quechua word that means I am thinking, I am remembering; under this name, the theater group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru. The group is comprised of seven actors (Augusto Casafranca, Amiel Cayo, Ana Correa, Débora Correa, Rebeca Ralli, Teresa Ralli, and Julián Vargas), a technical designer (Fidel Melquíades), and an artistic director (Miguel Rubio), who have made a commitment to collective creation as a mode of theatrical production and to group theater as a life style. Their work has been among the most important in Latin Americas so called New Popular Theater, with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy. Yuyachkani won Perus National Human Rights Award in 2000. Known for its creative embrace of both indigenous performance forms as well as cosmopolitan theatrical forms, Yuyachkani offers insight into Peruvian and Latin American theater, and to broader issues of postcolonial social aesthetics.

=520  \\$aAll three plays of 'The Oresteia' in one 3-hour performance were staged in a converted bandshell in the Da'An Forest Park at the center of Taipei. The bandshell was completely made over into a circular orchestra and skene. More than 2,500 spectators sat on the hillside. Some of the action took place among them - for example, Agamemnon makes his triumphal entry after the victory at Troy by being pulled in a chariot across the crest of the hill through the crowds of spectators. The doomed warrior-king, greeted by his regal wife Clytemnestra, steps onto a 75' long strip of purple cloth. As Agamemnon disappears into the palace, Cassandra, in the back of the chariot howls her despairing prophecy. In the second act, 'The Libation Bearers,' Orestes arrives at his father's tomb, set far up on the hillside. During the third act, 'The Eumenides,' the Furies pursue Orestes through the audience. 
=520  \\$aThe production is in jingju (classical 'Beijing Opera') with its distinct singing styles (accompanied by a full Chinese orchestra), costumes, and staging. But there are also surprising interruptions of post-modernity. The leading performers - Wu Hsing-kuo and Wei Hai-min are Taiwan's leading classical Chinese actors. The play is performed in Mandarin with portions in older kinds of Chinese particular to jingju. There are some lines in Taiwanese as a character in modern dress explains the story to the Taiwanese-speaking audience. Richard Schechner is a theater director, performance theorist and university professor known for being one of the founders of the academic discipline of Performance Studies at Tisch School of the Arts, New York University. Schechner combines his work in anthropology with innovative approaches to performance of all kinds including ritual, drama, environmental theater, political rallies, dance, music, etc.

He is the editor of 'TDR: The Journal of Performance Studies.' His books include 'Environmental Theater,' 'The Future of Ritual,' 'Performance Theory,' 'Between Theater and Anthropology' and 'Performance Studies: An Introduction.' As of 2007, his books have been translated into 14 languages.

=520  \\$a'Pluma y la tempestad' tells the story of a youngster (who could be a boy or a girl), born in a hostile world, growing up on the streets like a boat adrift, like a feather in the storm ('como pluma en la tempestad'), tossed and turned by the ever-changing gusts of life. It is the story of a marginalized person, exposed to all kinds of dangers, coerced to sell out, to compromise, to resign himself, but still, against all odds, chooses self-affirmation and the development of her own individuality, struggling to survive and go on, recycling the debris left by the storm. 'Pluma' poses a critique on society's political, religious and pedagogical institutions. A strange parable on what it entails being different, misunderstood, marginalized by society, Pluma is also a spiritual hermaphrodite of sorts, a metaphor for the idealist, a subject full of hope but unable to succeed, to express himself, to belong, to be a welcomed member of society. This video documents key excerpts form Malayerba's renowned production. The Grupo de Teatro Malayerba (teatromalayerba.org) was founded in Quito in 1979 by Arístides Vargas, Susana Pautasso and María del Rosario 'Charo' Francés, immigrant actors originally from Argentina and Spain. From the start, Malayerba included actors with various backgrounds and nationalities, invested in the exploration of the rich cultural diversity and complex history of Ecuador, as well as issues of migration, exile, political violence and individual and collective memory. With over 25 years of ongoing theater practice and more than 20 plays performed locally and internationally for a diverse audience, Malayerba is committed to theater pedagogy and experimentation, artistic collaboration, and community building. They have represented Ecuador in national and international theater festivals; they have also collaborated with theater groups within Ecuador and in other countries, and performed for both film and television, while engaging in community work in Quito. In 1989 the group created the Laboratorio Malayerba, committed to the training of generations of young Ecuadorian actors and to an ongoing investigation of theories and practices of experimental theater. In 2001 Malayerba launched the theater journal 'Hoja de Teatro,' conceived as a forum for the theorization, criticism and dissemination of Ecuadorian theater practices. The group also runs a theater house, the Casa Malayerba, which houses the Laboratory as well as a theater with seating capacity for seventy people. Malayerba approaches theater making as an artistic, ethical and technical realm where to engage in meaningful creative experiences through which to understand, assume and confront current sociopolitical processes. In working together, actors with various backgrounds and nationalities have shown that a multicultural blend is not only possible but also enriching, as differences lead to new identities, embodiments of dreams, memories, absences and pains that are at once local and universal.

=518  \\$aRecorded at the Franklin Furnace, New York, NY, USA, on April 28, 1995.
=520  \\$aFranklin Furnace Founding Director Martha Wilson discusses the political landscape of the arts organization in the context of the avant-garde and the culture wars in the United States. Wilson situates performance art as a confrontational form that emerged from Futurism, Constructivism, and Dadaism in the early 20th century. She describes the radical nature of performance art as a medium that transmits conceptual thinking through live actions, as evidenced by the work of Franklin Furnace artists Karen Finley, Annie Sprinkle, and Scarlet O. Wilson explains how the political subject matter embodied by these artists—feminism, pornography, and sexuality—impacted Franklin Furnace as an arts organization in the conservative climate of the culture wars. She notes the consistent attacks by religious right groups on Franklin Furnace that led to defunding from the National Endowment for the Arts, as the organization was accused of presenting obscene art with government funds. Despite the upheaval, Wilson, in true avant-garde fashion, insisted that ‘Until they cart me away in a straightjacket, I am going to continue to present performance art.’ While an advocate for government funding, Wilson is critical of the regulation of content in the arts—a phenomenon that did not manifest in other sectors of public funding at the time.
=520  \\$aMartha Wilson is a pioneering gallery director and feminist artist who creates innovative photographic and video works that explore her female subjectivity. Wilson founded Franklin Furnace in 1976, an artist-run space that champions the exploration, promotion, and preservation of artist books, temporary installation, performance art, as well as online works. She has been described by New York Times critic Holland Cotter as one of ‘the half-dozen most important people for art in downtown Manhattan in the 1970s.’ Wilson has received fellowships for performance art from the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York Foundation for the Arts; Bessie and Obie awards for commitment to artists’ freedom of expression; a Yoko Ono Lennon Courage Award for the Arts; a Richard Massey Foundation-White Box Arts and Humanities Award; and an Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design University. www.marthawilson.com

=518  \\$aRecorded at the Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 1995.
=520  \\$aBorrowing from history the famous sentence used by Dom Pedro I to declare the Independence of Brazil, 'Independence or Death!', Ói Nóis creates a new and unofficial version of the formation of Brazilian society. The purpose is to demystify the so-called 'heroes,' and to put the true workforce and culture of this country into its rightful place. The invasion of the land of the Native Americans and the expatriation and enslavement of African peoples serve as a narrative structure, exemplifying the oppression and poverty in which the majority of the Brazilians still live. The light-hearted and ironic tone with which the official 'heroes' are treated brings some air to the moldy way the history of this country has been told, praising the name of a few while neglecting the rest.
=520  \\$aBased in Porto Alegre, The Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz was born in 1978 out of a desire for a radical renovation of the language of theatre. During the several years of their existence, they have created a personal aesthetics founded upon the authorial work of the actor, both on the stage and on the streets. Their venue, the Terreira da Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, works as a community theatre school, offering several free workshops open to the public. Their tribal organization is based on the principle of collective work, both in the creative process and in the maintenance of the space. For Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, theater is an instrument for both revealing and analyzing reality, and it's function is social: to contribute to the collective knowledge and to the improvement of the quality of life of the people. In a world marked by exclusion, marginalization, homogenization, by dehumanizing and barbaric efforts, they see it as their moral imperative to denounce injustice, sold opinions, authoritarianism, mediocrity and the erasing of memory. Ói Nóis sees theatre as an art of resistance, in the service of arts and politics, an art that does not fit the market patterns for ethics and aesthetics. Instead, they see theater as a way of life and as a vehicle for ideas: a theater that does not comment on life, but that takes part in it.

=520  \\$aThe story of 'Un señor muy viejo con unas alas enormes' by renowned Colombian writer Gabriel García Márquez is here staged in the traditional art of Theru Koothu of Southern India as a collaboration between two companies, Purisai Duraisami Kannappa Thambiran Paramparai Therukoothu Mandram of Tamil Nadu, and Mapa Teatro of Bogotá, Colombia. The story metaphorically unravels as an intercultural, theatrical and human experience: a man from another world appears one day, fallen from the sky into the backyard of Pelayo, a villager and his wife, Elisenda. The production is, for both companies, an experience of alterity and difference, where an experimental theater from the 'new continent' searches in the traditions of popular theater from the 'thousand-year-old continent,' looking for thriving ritual forms and a 'total language' capable of illuminating the dark paths of contemporary theater, while the ancient epic art of Theru Koothu discovers, in the work of a contemporary playwright and in the gaze of Mapa Teatro's theater, the possibility of exploring new horizons and revitalizing its own tradition. According to Mapa Teatro, the experience revealed 'a post-dramatic theatrical form approaching pre-dramatic forms and vice-versa, creating a dialogue between past and present over the space of the performance itself.' Approx. first 20 min. of this video documentation is dedicated to backstage pre-performance activities, following various actors through parts of their preparation routine in drinking coffee, applying make-up and sitting about a large room together. A brief interview with Heidi and Rolf Abderhalden of Mapa Teatro contextualizes their working relationship, while actors sit behind them applying make-up in the background. The video concludes with two fragments of the performance recorded by two different cameras.

=520  \\$aCo-Madres (co-founders) talk about the creation of Latina Theatre Lab and the creative process of producing original work with 'El Amanecer' host, Isabel Lucero. An excerpt of 'The Miracle,' from The Immaculate Conception, is part of this video. Latina Theatre Lab was one of the first and only all-Latina collective of writers, performers, and directors in the U.S. Their performance-sketch work dealt with pop culture, immigration, cross-cultural identities, and the complexities of 'being Latina.' It was founded in 1994 by four San Francisco Bay Area actresses known as the 'comadres': Dena Martinez, Jaime Lujan, Tessa Koning-Martinez and Wilma Bonet. Their purpose was to create theater that would go beyond the ever shrinking and limited range of roles for which Latina actresses were being considered. These roles were scarce, and rarely defied stereotypes. From 1994-1999, Latina Theatre Lab's work played with these cultural and gender stereotypes, exploring the legacies they inherited both as Latinas and as women. They also have collaborated with fellow comedy troupes in California, such as Culture Clash, the Asian American Theater Company, and the 18 Mighty Mountain Warriors.

=520  \\$aMore than Feather and Beads is Murielle Borsts semi-autobiographical one-woman show which examines contemporary issues of identity for Native American women. Borst is a champion shawl dancer and wrote this theatrical comedy about her experiences competing in pow-wows across the country. As the title implies she finds there's more than feathers and beads to the pow-wow scene. Murielle Borst is the daughter of Muriel Miguel, the co-founder of Spiderwoman Theater, the longest running Native women's theater troupe in the country. She has appeared as a guest artist in several Spiderwoman's productions and has also appeared in and collaborated on several works with the American Indian Youth Theater Project, which is a part of the American Indian Community Houses (AICH) American Indian Youth Council. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city. AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto neighborhood serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area. The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICHs Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICHs visual and performing arts department programs. Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badgers Corner.

=520  \\$aIn the eye of a storm, far from anywhere, a man and a woman hang on to life. The decision at hand: reach the other shore, return, or abandon all hope. 'La otra orilla' is based on the play 'Obra póstuma' by Eusebio Colange, resident playwright of the theater group La Zaranda in Jerez de la Frontera, Spain. It is inspired in the tragedy of many lives lost in the Caribbean waters. Pregones infuses the playwright's words with the company's signature live music and physical vocabulary, and creates new characters anchored in the experience/history of Latinos in the U.S. 'This work means a lot to us, as it addresses painful issues connected to migration. Thousands of Puerto Ricans have left Puerto Rico over the years, many other thousands have gone back. Many have been born here and wish to connect with their other shore. Many don't want to leave at all. Hundreds of Dominican, Cuban and Haitian people die as their boats sink in the Caribbean waters; many of them also make it to the other shore. Collectively, we have proven that we rise against adversity, our resistance growing each day. We hope that the play will touch our audience, and that, wherever your other shore may be, you be happy with the discovery.' The production was premiered at the Repertory Theater of Hostos Center for the Arts & Culture in The Bronx, in June, 1996. Founded in 1979 and based in The Bronx, New York City, Pregones Theater (http://www.pregones.org) has performed in more than 400 cities and 13 countries. The company enjoys citywide recognition for their lasting contributions to the performing arts field and are recipients of numerous distinctions including current Leading National Ensemble Theatre Designation from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Primary Cultural Institution Designation from the New York State Council on the Arts, the New York State Governor's Arts Award, the Culture & Humanities Award from the Center for Puerto Rican Studies, numerous artist and production awards, as well as invitations to appear at international festivals and events. Over the years Pregones has developed a style that combines theater, music and movement, oral and written traditions, and a signature urban sensibility. The ensemble draws from popular Puerto Rican artistic expressions and literature to create and stage its work. Today, Pregones has grown to be one of the leading Puerto Rican/Latino theater theaters in the United States. From migrations to indigenous mythologies to subway stories, the company's repertoire covers a growing sample of Latino experiences and identities.

=520  \\$aThe Coatlicue Theater Company's 'A Traditional Kind of Woman: Too Much, Not 'Nuff,' deals with issues of domestic violence, incest, rape, HIV/AIDS, alcoholism, drugs, cancer, diabetes, nutrition and racism. This piece was commissioned by the American Indian Community House's (AICH) Women's Wellness Circle. It was developed from healing and empowerment stories collected from women from the community with the goal of empowering other Native women. Using music, song and 'larger than life' props, the sisters communicate the heartbreak, absurdity, pain, humor and power of the stories. It has been shown across the country to Native audiences, healthcare providers and at numerous conferences. Elvira and Hortencia Colorado, Chichimec Otomi storytellers, playwrights, performers and community activists are founding members of Coatlicue Theatre Company (www.coatlicue.com). They are also members of Danza Mexica Cetiliztli, New York Zapatistas and the American Indian Community House. The company's plays address social, political, cultural and identity issues that impact their lives and their community. Their work is based on stories they weave together which educate as well as entertain, while reaffirming their survival as urban Native American women. They have conducted storytelling/ theatre workshops. They are recipients of the Ingrid Washinawatok Community Activism Award. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city. AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto 'neighborhood' serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area. The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICH's Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980's, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICH's visual and performing arts department programs. Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badger's Corner.

Elvira and Hortencia Colorado explain the piece as being 'a journey through dreams, stories, time and memory, across mountains and deserts, retracing the footsteps of the ancestors, traveling back to Chicomoztoc (the place of our origin), searching, digging up and gathering stories that have been buried through centuries of shame and denial in our family, but which connect us to our past and identity.

=520  \\$aAn afternoon of storytelling at the American Indian Community House. By the 1950s over 700 Mohawk ironworkers and their families were living in the Boerum Hill section of Brooklyn, New York which they called downtown Kahnawake after a reservations in upstate New York. For years the Mohawks commuted between their reservations in upstate New York and Canada and Brooklyn until many grew weary and permanently moved to Brooklyn. Their community flourished with help from local merchants who began catering to their needs. Dr. David Munroe Corey, the pastor of the Cuyler Presbyterian Church, opened his church to support community activities. He attracted worshipers by delivering services in Mohawk once a month, and in 1939, with the help of two parishioners, translated a hymnal into Mohawk. This appears to be the first time Native people had a community located in a specific neighborhood in New York City.

=518  \\$aRecorded in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 1996.
=520  \\$aBased on Augusto Boal’s play 'O homem que era uma fábrica,' this street performance tells the story of Matilda Silva da Silva, an unemployed Brazilian woman who is trying to get a visa to the United States in order to fulfill her dream of a job and a place to live. Helped by her friend Santinha, Matilda needs to go through several obstacles to overcome the sanitary rules of the United States embassy, which bar the people of Pindaíba from imigrating. Free from amoebas and bacteria, our hero transforms her fecal matter in a symbol for Brazilian clean feces, creating the possibility of becoming rich selling feces to all those people who also dream with the pleasures of the 'American way of life.' Registering Brazil’s social situation through allegory and farce, the clown characters are an expression of Brazil’s popular theatre, establishing a connection with the people in the streets. The humor and playfulness hide a strong critical power.
=520  \\$aBased in Porto Alegre, The Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz was born in 1978 out of a desire for a radical renovation of the language of theatre. During the several years of their existence, they have created a personal aesthetics founded upon the authorial work of the actor, both on the stage and on the streets. Their venue, the Terreira da Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, works as a community theatre school, offering several free workshops open to the public. Their tribal organization is based on the principle of collective work, both in the creative process and in the maintenance of the space. For Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, theater is an instrument for both revealing and analyzing reality, and it's function is social: to contribute to the collective knowledge and to the improvement of the quality of life of the people. In a world marked by exclusion, marginalization, homogenization, by dehumanizing and barbaric efforts, they see it as their moral imperative to denounce injustice, sold opinions, authoritarianism, mediocrity and the erasing of memory. Ói Nóis sees theatre as an art of resistance, in the service of arts and politics, an art that does not fit the market patterns for ethics and aesthetics. Instead, they see theater as a way of life and as a vehicle for ideas: a theater that does not comment on life, but that takes part in it.

=520  \\$aThis itinerant performance/installation present two 'end-of-the-century saints' from an 'unknown border religion', in search of sanctuary across the United States while gathering confessions on intercultural fears and desires. Designed as a theater of mythos and cultural pathologies, the 'Temple' proposes a ceremonial space for the reflection on ethnic, racial, and gender prejudices. It is divided in three main areas: the 'Chapel of Desires', displaying 'El Pre-Columbian Vato' or 'holy gang member' (performed by Roberto Sifuentes); the 'Chapel of Fears', displaying 'San Pocho Aztlaneca' (a 'hyper-exoticied curio shop shaman for spiritual tourists' performed by Guillermo Gómez-Peña); and an enigmatic funerary vignette composed by performance objects. Paintings of other 'hybrid santos' hang from the walls, two 'nuns' ('chola/nun' Norma Medina and 'dominatrix nun' Michelle Ceballos) take care of the temple, and visitors can leave their 'confessions'; the most revealing ones are incorporated into the installation soundtrack for future performances. La Pocha Nostra (www.pochanostra.com) is an ever-morphing trans-disciplinary arts organization, founded in 1993 by Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Roberto Sifuentes, and Nola Mariano in California. The objective was to formally conceptualize Gómez-Peña's collaborations with other performance artists. It provides a base (and forum) for a loose network of rebel artists from various disciplines, generations and ethnic backgrounds, whose common denominator is the desire to cross and erase dangerous borders between art and politics, practice and theory, artist and spectator. As of June 2006, members include performance artists Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Violeta Luna, Michelle Ceballos, and Roberto Sifuentes; curators Gabriela Salgado and Orlando Britto; and over thirty associates worldwide in countries such as Mexico, Spain, the UK, and Australia. Projects range from performance solos and duets to large-scale performance installations including video, photography, audio, and cyber-art. La Pocha collaborates across national borders, race, gender and generations. Their collaborative model functions both as an act of citizen diplomacy and as a means to create ephemeral communities of like-minded rebels. The basic premise of these collaborations is founded on an ideal: If we learn to cross borders on stage, we may learn how to do so in larger social spheres. La Pocha strives to eradicate myths of purity and dissolve borders surrounding culture, ethnicity, gender, language, and métier. These are radical acts.

=520  \\$aAs a pre-performance strategy for advertising their upcoming 'The Temple of Confessions' performance/installation, La Pocha Nostra conducts a series of interventions in Detroit's public sphere. Two 'end-of-the-century saints', in search of sanctuary across the United States while gathering confessions on intercultural fears and desires, take on key politically relevant or visually interesting public sites. 'El Pre-Columbian Vato' or 'holy gang member' (performed by Roberto Sifuentes) and 'San Pocho Aztlaneca' (a 'hyper-exoticied curio shop shaman for spiritual tourists' performed by Guillermo Gómez-Peña) are walked in leashes by 'corporate dominatrix' Michelle Ceballos and tended by 'chola/nun' Norma Medina; in this fashion, they visit an array of public places, from a financial/downtown district fancy café, to the US-Canada border, always followed by an entourage of photographers and videographers from the local media that document their 'pilgrimage'. 
=520  \\$aThrough these performative irruptions in everyday life, La Pocha Nostra creates the means for provoking in the "Temple" prospective audience an aura of expectation, a bearing witness of a mythology of intercultural fears and desires; this, in turn, would broaden the diversity of the audience, and create a propitious environment for their upcoming 'confessions'.

Performances in the Circle at AICH were videotaped, edited, and aired on the Manhattan Neighborhood Network in half hour segments. This episode of 'Native America' contains a performance by members of the Thunderbird American Indian Dancers, the first piece features two female dancers and the second, two male - in both, one dancer does traditional Native dance while the other does improvisational dance. The male dancers are Louis Mofsie (Hopi/Winnebago) and Michael Taylor (Delaware). The episode also features the Native American blues-rock group 'Indigenous,' which consists of three brothers, Mato Nanji (vocals and guitar), Pte (bass), Horse (percussion), and their sister, Wanbdi (drums, vocals). The siblings are members of the Nakota Nation and grew up on the Yankton Indian Reservation in South Dakota. The Thunderbird American Indian Dancers traces its roots back to a group of teenagers called the Little Eagles, which included director Louis Mofsie. Each member had a very distinct and different cultural background and as a group they were determined to first learn and preserve the songs and dances of their own tribes and then to branch out to include those of other tribes. As adults, the Little Eagles transformed themselves into the Thunderbird American Indian Dancers. Today, the Thunderbird's annual powwow, performance, and auction raise critical scholarship money for Indian students. Now over 30 years old, the group brings the beauty of traditional Native American culture to both American Indian and non-Indian audiences. Specializing in a variety of distinct regional tribal dances, their performances are wonderfully presented with narrative stories. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city. AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto 'neighborhood' serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area. The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICH's Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980's, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICH's visual and performing arts department programs. Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badger's Corner.

=520  \\$aFor several years the American Indian Community House (AICH) produced a cable network show titled 'Native America.' Select performances in the Circle at AICH were videotaped, edited, and aired on the Manhattan Neighborhood Network in half hour segments. This episode contains performances by Ulali and the Silvercloud Singers. Ulali (www.ulali.com), formerly known as Pura Fe, is an a cappella women's trio featuring three Native women singers, Pura Fe (Tuscarora), Soni Moreno (Apache/Mayan) and Jennifer Kreisberg (Tuscarora). Ulali blends a variety of traditional and contemporary indigenous music of the Americas, incorporating political, social and personal issues that affect all of humanity. By fusing outside influences with Native words and music, Ulali challenges notions of how 'traditional' words and concepts are applicable in the modern world. The group can be heard on dozens of albums, documentaries and movies. The SilverCloud Singers (www.silvercloudsingers.com) are an intertribal Native American singing & dance troupe weaving the traditional with the contemporary of Native song & dance. SilverCloud was founded in 1991 and takes its name in tribute of Josephine Mofsie Tarrant, the mother of founding members Kevin Tarrant and Michael Tarrant, and current members Donald Tarrant and Judy Tarrant Fields. The singers of SilverCloud come from many tribes, and from many parts of the U.S and Canada. The group was started with the intention of using traditional methods of Native culture as a means to educate through song and dance. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city. AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto 'neighborhood' serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area.

=520  \\$a‘Combination Skin,’ written by Lisa Jones and directed by Roberta Uno, explores the racial politics that has been imposed upon black individuals, proposing ‘Who says it's the black man’s burden to be black.’ Taking a look to historical figures and racial stereotypes, the conversations on stage go towards black skin tonality, discussing if ‘combination skin’ defines, or not, our own identities. Even more, whiteness as a counterpart of black identity is brought as a desired space for hiding the skin color that is related to negativity, and ‘dreaming of a white life.’ Playing with irony, and acknowledging that the fears embedded in centuries of a history of oppression are not easy to dissolve, the characters engage within a game show scenario that announces the winners of the whitest black person – a gesture that moves between sarcasm and despair.
=520  \\$aFrom 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a ‘new world’ - one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting demographics. From a geographic ‘outpost’ in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, methods, and production. One of New WORLD Theater’s artistic legacies is Project 2050, an early call to imagine the U.S. demographic shift, with people of the future - youth, in equal collaboration with artists and scholars.

=520  \\$aFOMMA - Fortaleza de la Mujer Maya - is a collective of Mayan women who use theater as a tool for education and community building. They are performers, playwrights, and teachers who tour their work in their communities and internationally, performing plays that focus on women's and indigenous rights, literacy, cultural survival, ecology, health, and education in the Tzeltal and Tzotzil indigenous languages. 'Migración' tackles the issues that result from an increasingly common phenomenon in which indigenous people leave their subsistence farms in order to seek higher paying jobs in nearby cities. The loss of support from communities, the racism and discrimination indigenous people face in the cities, and the disintegration of relationships in the face of new hardships are all themes explored within the play. The performance is followed by a Q & A.

=520  \\$a‘New Works For a New World’ includes video excerpts of three plays featured by New WORLD Theater’s summer playlab program in 1996. ‘The Bodies Between Us,’ a solo performance by lê thị diem thúy, explores the politics of ‘mixed race’ and generational links through the female body. The piece is a reflection upon relationships with a tradition and racial and ethnic backgrounds as the legacy inherited from ancestors, and what would be given, in turn, to future generations born in the wake of diasporic and migration movements. ‘Chicomoztoc/Mimixcoa: Cloud Serpents,’ by Elvira Colorado and Hortencia Colorado, from Coatlicue Theater Company, is a work-in-progress that discusses the metaphorical relationship between railroad tracks and a family history marked by migration. ‘Las Colorado’ explain the piece as being ‘a journey through dreams, stories, time and memory, across mountains and deserts, retracing the footsteps of the ancestors, traveling back to Chicomoztoc (the place of our origin), searching, digging up and gathering stories that have been buried through centuries of shame and denial in our family, but which connect us to our past and identity. Some stories/secrets remain buried, and they are also part of who we are.’ ‘The Return of Elijah, The African,’ by Sekou Sundiata, interweaves spoken word with jazz singers and band. Music and poetry recount together the origins of slavery, as well as the evils of master-slave dynamics of oppression. ‘New Works For a New World’ constitutes a complex canvas that encompasses the power of diverse languages: the language of the body, the language in translation, the language of music, and the transformative sound of meaningful voices.

=520  \\$aThe Immaculate Conception is a play that explores Virgin, Mother, Whore mythology and stereotypes. Body types and image topics were developed in a workshop: What does a Virgin look like? A Whore? A Latina? Do we get these ideas from magazines? Television? Men? Each other? Is there a God? A Goddess? And why are all Latinas expected to know how to salsa dance??? Latina Theatre Lab was one of the first and only all-Latina collective of writers, performers, and directors in the U.S. Their performance-sketch work dealt with pop culture, immigration, cross-cultural identities, and the complexities of 'being Latina.' The group was founded in 1994 by four San Francisco Bay Area actresses: Dena Martinez, Jaime Lujan, Tessa Koning-Martinez and Wilma Bonet. Their purpose was to create theater that would go beyond the ever shrinking and limited range of roles for which Latina actresses were being considered. These roles were scarce, and rarely defied stereotypes. From 1994-1999, Latina Theatre Lab's work played with these cultural and gender stereotypes, exploring the legacies they inherited both as Latinas and as women.

=520  \\$aFor several years the American Indian Community House (AICH) produced a cable network show titled Native America. Select performances in the Circle at AICH were videotaped, edited, and aired on the Manhattan Neighborhood Network in half hour segments. This episode contains performances by the SilverCloud Singers, an inter-tribal drum group whose members are a part of the Native community of New York City. The SilverClouds perform traditional Native American pow-wow songs and demonstrate three different styles of dances popular at today's pow-wows. Also featured in this episode are the Thunderbird American Indian Dancers. The SilverCloud Singers are an intertribal Native American singing & dance troupe weaving the traditional with the contemporary of Native song & dance. SilverCloud was founded in 1991 and takes its name in tribute of Josephine Mofsie Tarrant, the mother of founding members Kevin Tarrant and Michael Tarrant, and current members Donald Tarrant and Judy Tarrant Fields. The singers of SilverCloud come from many tribes, and from many parts of the U.S and Canada. The group was started with the intention of using traditional methods of Native culture as a means to educate through song and dance. The Thunderbird American Indian Dancers traces its roots back to a group of teenagers called the Little Eagles, which included director Louis Mofsie. Each member had a very distinct and different cultural background and as a group they were determined to first learn and preserve the songs and dances of their own tribes and then to branch out to include those of other tribes. As adults, the Little Eagles transformed themselves into the Thunderbird American Indian Dancers. Today, the Thunderbirds annual powwow, performance, and auction raise critical scholarship money for Indian students. Now over 30 years old, the group brings the beauty of traditional Native American culture to both American Indian and non-Indian audiences. Specializing in a variety of distinct regional tribal dances, their performances are wonderfully presented with narrative stories. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city. AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto neighborhood serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area. The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICHs Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICHs visual and performing arts department programs. Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badgers Corner.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of Circus Amok's show, 'Money Amok', performed in 1996 in diverse New York City parks, squares and other public spaces. The piece revolves around the political and social implications of the current U.S.economic climate. Issues like financial monopolies, budget safety nets, financial loopholes, the national debt, the cutting of social programs, the corporate dependence on government handouts, and the unequal distribution of wealth under the idea of 'progress' are all managed in the skits comprising the performance. Through the unveiling of these issues, the piece poses an open call for civic activism and empowerment, a demand for justice and for a revision of the coordinates of American civil life, all interwoven in a joyful extravaganza of acrobatic artistry, satiric skill, and good old-fashioned circus fun. Circus Amok (www.circusamok.org) is a New York City based circus-theater company whose mission is to provide free public art addressing contemporary issues of social justice to the people of NYC. Directed and founded by Jennifer Miller, the group has been together since 1989 bringing its funny, queer, caustic and sexy, political one-ring spectacles to diverse neighborhoods throughout the city. Over the years the traditional circus skills - tight rope walking, juggling, acrobatics, stilt walking, clowning - have been combined with experimental dance, lifesize puppetry, music old and new, and gender-bending performance art and improvisational techniques, creating new meanings for circus while continuing to entertain the crowds of all ages throughout the city streets, gardens, parks, and playgrounds, inviting the audience to join them in envisioning a more empowered life of community interaction while enjoying a queer celebratory spectacle.

His stories are from several different tribes and relay messages that have informed the lives of Native people for hundreds of years. Storytelling remains a strong force in Native American life. Johnny Moses (Tulalip) (www.johnnymoses.com), was raised in the remote Nuu-chah-nulth village of Ohiat on the west coast of Vancouver Island, B.C., Canada. He is a master storyteller, oral historian and traditional healer and shares his knowledge through storytelling, lectures and workshops.

=520  \\$aStorytelling remains a strong force in Native American life. Johnny Moses' stories are from several different tribes and relay messages that have informed the lives of Native people for hundreds of years. Johnny Moses (www.johnnymoses.com) is a Tulalip Indian raised in the remote Nuu-chah-nulth village of Ohiat on the west coast of Vancouver Island, B.C., Canada. He is a master storyteller, oral historian and traditional healer and shares his knowledge through storytelling, lectures and workshops. Moses, whose Indian name is Whis.stem.men.knee (Walking Medicine Robe), is fluent in eight Native languages and is a traveling ambassador for the northwest coast cultures. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city. AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto neighborhood serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area. The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICHs Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICHs visual and performing arts department programs. Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badgers Corner.

=520  \\$aDaughters from the Stars is a Spiderwoman Theater performance about mending the riffs and misunderstanding created by physical and emotional borders. The performance was written and performed by Brooklyn sisters Gloria Miguel and Lisa Mayo, (Kuna/Rappahannock), whose mother was a Rappahannock Indian from Virginia and father was a Kuna Indian from Panama. Based loosely on the sisters travel to the San Blas Islands (their father's homeland), Daughters relates to their experiences and attempts to connect and integrate family from the North with the South. Daughters emerged from the Lisa Mayos a one woman piece entitled, Voices from the Criss-Cross Bridge. Spiderwoman Theater is the longest continuous running Native female performance group. Comprised of three Kuna/ Rappahannock sisters from Brooklyn, New York, Lisa Mayo, Gloria Miguel, and Muriel Miguel, the group has travel all over the world giving performance, lectures, and workshops. Named after the weaver in the Hopi creation story the sisters storyweave their message in a variety of formats including poetry, dance, theater, and song.

=520  \\$aThis play, directed by Teresa Ralli and created in collaboration with Ana Correa, Rebecca Ralli and Lucia Lora in 1996, explores the interplay between women's subjective realm and the social sphere, in the line of the broader ongoing investigation on women's issues developed by the female members of the Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani. Three friends meet up to cook and share a supper on the last day of the last year of the XXth century, honoring a pact made twenty years before. Only two of the original three friends arrive (the third, a militant worker for human rights, has been murdered); in her place, her daughter (played by Lucia Lora) arrives to honor the pact made by her mother. All three women are in different stages in their lives. The first character (played by Ana Correa) was the top of her class in High School but, upon graduation, she quickly married and had five kids who are her entire life now. The second character (played by Rebecca Ralli) realized her High School dreams by becoming an artist, but stopped painting when she entered into a bad marriage ten years after graduation. The third character, the daughter of the third friend, is resentful because, although her mother had time for the rights of other children, she feels that she never had time for her. The three women revisit their lives and the moments they feel that changed the course of their destiny. They decide that this will be the first supper ('la primera cena') of their new lives. In the middle of dinner, the 'Goddess of the Kitchen' appears (in this play, the kitchen functions as a metaphor for life); the characters revalue the knowledge and wisdom of women (in the context of the space of the kitchen), ultimately inviting the audience to share their first supper with them by eating the soup they were actually cooking on stage. Peru's most important theater collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani (www.yuyachkani.org) has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. 'Yuyachkani' is a Quechua word that means 'I am thinking, I am remembering'; under this name, the theater group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru. The group is comprised of seven actors (Augusto Casafranca, Amiel Cayo, Ana Correa, Débora Correa, Rebeca Ralli, Teresa Ralli, and Julián Vargas), a technical designer (Fidel Melquíades), and an artistic director (Miguel Rubio), who have made a commitment to collective creation as a mode of theatrical production and to group theater as a life style. Their work has been among the most important in Latin America's so called 'New Popular Theater,' with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy. Yuyachkani won Peru's National Human Rights Award in 2000. Known for its creative embrace of both indigenous performance forms as well as cosmopolitan theatrical forms, Yuyachkani offers insight into Peruvian and Latin American theater, and to broader issues of postcolonial social aesthetics.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of Puerto Rican experimental dance performance ‘Miss Puerto Rico o La isla que se repite,’ choreographed by Viveca Vázquez as a part of ‘A alboroto limpio,’ a project organized and directed by Nelson Rivera, which also included dance pieces by Oscar Mestey and Awilda Sterling. Viveca Vázquez is a choreographer, dancer, and a professor of humanities and contemporary dance for actors at the University of Puerto Rico. She presented her first work with Pisotón, the first experimental dance group of Puerto Rico and, shortly after, Taller de Otra Cosa, of which she became the first director. Through the company she presented her choreographic work and produced events such as ‘Rompeforma’ a key festival in the development of the experimental dance and performance scene in Puerto Rico, which was co-produced with Puerto Rican choreographer based in the U.S. Merian Soto. Since 1984 she has produced and performed experimental dance works in the United States, Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina, among a great number of other places. As a teacher she has developed a pedagogical model based on body conscience and improvisation. ‘Miss Puerto Rico o la isla que se repite’ is a contemporary experimental dance and performance that dialogues with the cultural climate in Puerto Rico. Vázquez reflects upon the figure of Miss Puerto Rico performing in bath clothes and a ‘crown’ with the shape of the island. The logic of beauty contests is questioned by the contrast between ‘graceful’ movements and a struggling body, which is a tool and an obstacle at the same time. The political implications of this dance performance suggest a major role of the citizens in Puerto Rico’s sovereignty: how is ‘the island,’ as a geographical body, related to the physical body, and the political body?

=520  \\$aIn this solo performance by Jesusa Rodríguez, current pressing social and economic problems affecting Mexico City are discussed in the context of political campaigns to the regency of this city. Economic polarization, failing infrastructure, political corruption, violation of human rights, mass media manipulation of public opinion, the religious prohibition of birth control methods, and a severe drought are topics discussed by a myriad of characters, satiric lyrics, and video inserts projected on the back wall of the stage. Rodríguez mocks Mexico's main political parties (PRI, PAN) and the disparity between their campaign promises and the political corruption that worsens the urban crisis. Several candidates to the regency of the city are proposed, alluding to actual politicians, but expanding the political 'bestiary' to the fabulous 'Chupacabras' (the 'Goatsucker,' invoked to suck the technocrats' blood), 'Babe, el Puerquito Valiente' ('Babe, the Brave Piglet,' a symbol of 'dirty politics'), Keiko the Whale ('all regents are animals... at least this one needs water as much as the rest of the population'), and even resorting to propose Coatlicue, Aztec goddess of life and death (who promises to end privatization, greed, and corruption among 'her children'). An alternative 'History of the Collapse of Tenochtitlan' and the satiric version of Venezuelan folk song 'Alma Llanera' are examples of how this performance confronts streetwise wits with the mirage of urban prosperity advertised by TV commercials, newscasts, and political campaign slogans, acknowledging how electoral decisions affect 'the future of Mexico... if there's such thing.' Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodréguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a chameleon, Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her espectáculos (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and carpa, to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguezs energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: I am going to die with that woman. Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. In this off-off space, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas, Jesusa y Liliana have produced hundreds of shows since the 1980s.

=520  \\$aPerformance video inserts, projected as a part of the piece 'Cuando el regente nos alcance.' The video skits span from original videos (like a mock version of Alfred Hitchcock's bathtub murder scene, related to Mexico City's drought), to satirical voice-overs for Mexican TV ads and newscasts, in order to expose and discuss the economic polarization, failing infrastructure, political corruption, violation of human rights, mass media manipulation of public opinion, the religious prohibition of birth control methods, and a severe drought affecting Mexico City, in relation to the political campaigns to the regency of the city. Several 'candidates' to the regency are proposed, including Keiko the whale ('all regents are animals... at least this one needs water as much as the rest of the population'). Biased newscast information is exposed inasmuch as it accents the disparity between the urban crisis and the mirage of urban prosperity advertised by TV commercials, newscasts, and political campaign slogans; the highlighted relationship between the drought and political corruption points to an acknowledgment of how electoral decisions affect 'the future of Mexico... if there?s such thing.' Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodréguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a chameleon, Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her espectáculos (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and carpa, to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguezs energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: I am going to die with that woman. Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. In this off-off space, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas, Jesusa y Liliana have produced hundreds of shows since the 1980s.

Performances included are Big Girl, Little Girl, a humorous look at etiquette training for young girls presented by Rebecca Romero & Co. (Cherokee), Stage Struck, an autobiographical piece about the trials and tribulations encountered by Steve Elm (Oneida) while in pursuit of a show business career, Whole Buffalo, written and choreographed by Chan (Maliseet)- a.k.a. Tony Spotten in homage to his ancestor who came of age during the first half of the twentieth century, and Trail of the Otter, performed by Muriel Miguel (Kuna/Rappahannock) of Spiderwoman Theater, which recounts Otter's ecological journey across the continent and encounters with AIDS, oil spills, greed, and battered women (the otter, which is in danger of becoming extinct is revered by many Native cultures and considered a trickster charged with the task of teaching life lesions, which like life can be absurd, cruel and very funny). 
=520  \\$aThe American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city. AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto neighborhood serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area. The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICHs Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICHs visual and performing arts department programs.   
=520  \\$aTaking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badgers Corner. Indian Summer is an annual event at AICH and an occasion for artists to present their latest works to the community and the general public. All performers, whether new to the field or veteran practitioners, are encouraged to present their work.

=520  \\$aThe Colectivo de Acciones de Arte (CADA) is a Chilean activist group of artists who used performance to challenge the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile. One of the most important contributors to the ‘Escena Avanzada’, CADA incorporated strategies of theatricality and performance as an essential element to all its ‘art actions’, while questioning the practices and institutions of all politics and conceiving art as a necessary social practice that eradicated the traditional distance between the artist and the spectator. Committed to the foundation of an open and spontaneous practice of spectatorship, their ‘interventions in everyday life’ intended to interrupt and alter the normalized routines of the daily urban life of the citizen, by means of a semiotic subversion that decontextualized and semantically restructured urban behaviors, locations and signs.
=520  \\$aOn the 10th year of Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship in Chile, CADA proposed the slogan 'NO +' (NO more). This was meant as an open text to be completed by the citizens, according to their specific social demands (No more ...). CADA invited Chilean artists from different fields to spread this message on walls all over Santiago. The slogan was soon used by different collectives all over the country as a massive public symbol of political resistance and non-conformity.
=520  \\$aThis documentary shows a series of interviews with Chilean intellectuals reflecting on the centrality of CADA for the resistance to the Pinochet dictatorship. The interviewees (Milan Ivelic, Nelly Richard, José Joaquín Brunner and Eugenia Brito) talk about the rupturist character of CADA vis-à-vis the Chilean art establishment, posing an interpenetration of art, politics and social critique in their work, and branding CADA as fundamental to the development of a field of political resistance and critical thinking among intellectuals.

=520  \\$aThe performance ‘Contraelviento’ (Against the Wind) was created by Peru’s leading theatre collective Yuyachkani in 1989, at the height of the country’s most recent civil conflict. It recounts the testimony of an indigenous survivor of the 1986 massacre at Soccos, in Ayacucho. Coya and her sister, Huaco, along with their father, are in the midst of colliding forces that destroy everything in the peasant village in the middle of the Andes where they live. The scenes of devastation correspond to the crossfire between terrorist group ‘Sendero Luminoso’ and the Peruvian Army that left civilians with no options for survival. The symbolic seeds of life would represent an option to preserve life, at the expense of the death of the peasants. Masked dancers and archangels fight for ownership of the peasants’ souls in the ‘danza de la diablada’ or Devil dance from the Fiesta de la Candelaria in Puno. After their death, the seeds of life are left by the peasants in the ground, and into the hands of the Ekeko, a constant figure on stage, who performs as witness of the story, and who will transmit both the seeds of life and the narration: ‘these seeds were given to me by a woman, who told me a story.’ The music, images, and voices bring Peruvian traditions to the stage, and at the same time reveal the miscommunications between those who hold power to exert either violence or justice, and the peasants who demand to be taking into account. The difficulties that they have to confront also encompass their constant efforts for survival – as Ekeko affirms: ‘the condor learnt to fly against the wind; now you have to follow him.’
=520  \\$aPeru’s most important theater collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. Yuyachkani is a Quechua word that means ‘I am thinking, I am remembering;’ under this name, the theater group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru. Their work has been among the most important in Latin Americas so called New Popular Theatre, with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy. Yuyachkani won Peru’s National Human Rights Award in 2000. Known for its creative embrace of both indigenous performance forms as well as cosmopolitan theatrical forms, Yuyachkani offers insight into Peruvian and Latin American theater, and to broader issues of postcolonial social aesthetics.

=520  \\$a‘R.A.W. (‘Cause I’m a Woman) is a short play written by Diana Son and directed by Roberta Uno. R.A.W. stands for ‘Raunchy Asian Woman,’ as the play intends to explore stereotypes about Asian woman, such as that of the geisha, the exotic virgin, or the suicidal Miss Saigon. An all Asian American women cast perform dance, music, and spoken word. Their voices address the politics between mixed raced relationships, specifically between Asian American women and white men; quotidian and apparently minimal things like asian hair in relation to a white woman’s hair; the experience of being a queer Asian woman; dating a Korean man from the perspective of a Korean woman, etc. All the characters come on stage and share their experiences of being Asian women in multiple shapes, forms, and identities.
=520  \\$aFrom 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a ‘new world’ - one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting demographics. From a geographic ‘outpost’ in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, methods, and production. One of New WORLD Theater’s artistic legacies is Project 2050, an early call to imagine the U.S. demographic shift, with people of the future - youth, in equal collaboration with artists and scholars.

By 1970 ETC had gained an international reputation, with major contributions to Chicano culture in the U.S. and to the development and expansion of the boundaries of theater everywhere. Theirs is a popular theater rooted in the American streets, early California history, Mayan/Aztec mythology and Mexican folklore and spiritualism, all geared toward expression of social, political and cultural perceptions. Valdez believes in a total theaterone where an elevation of sensation is achieved through a trinity of music, dance and drama to stimulate a New American Audience, a celebration of cultural diversity. This video documents a rehearsal of El Teatro Campesinos rendition of Alfred Jarrys play Ubu Roi. Directed by Kinan Valdez, this piece represents the newer generation of ETC which in the mid-nineties began to train in classic world theater while simultaneously pushing the envelope of the classic styles they were examining and of ETCs production choices. This production of Ubu was created in 1996 in the context of the 100-year anniversary of Jarry's Ubu. A satire of William Shakespeares Macbeth, Ubu has no ambition, is idiotic, and is pushed into a kingdom by his wife. In this production of Ubu Roi, instead of banishing Ubu out of the kingdom, he is banished to the New World.

=520  \\$aAdaptation of "Jardín de Pulpos", renowned play by Argentinean writer Arístides Vargas (of the Ecuadorian theater group Malayerba), directed by Rosa Luisa Márquez and collectively created with her students of the "Teatro Rodante" (Traveling Theater) of the University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus. A theater piece on memory, atrocity, affect and resistance, "Pulpos" bridges time (from a mythical time to the "Baby Boomers" to the "Generation X"), and place (with an Andean text rendered Caribbean, adapted to the Puerto Rican reality) in order to denounce political repression, police brutality, ideological persecution and political assassination, and to evoke and pay homage to our dead and disappeared. 
=520  \\$aAn organizing image is that of the "velorio" or wake for a lost child, (alluding to the canonical Puerto Rican painting by Francisco Oller and to a contemporary rendition by Rafael Trelles), in an exploration of memories of loss and a sense of community, of a broader Puerto Rican family. The recurring motif of the sea shore opens productive layers of signification, rhythm and spatial organization: it hints to the waters where Argentineans were "disappeared" during the dictatorship, the island of Puerto Rico's (geographic and political) borders, and to the Beatles' song "Octopus' Garden", which inspires the pieces title. The resulting performance is an open call to rescue and safeguard collective memories of political and historical events that have shaped our present Latin American societies. It is also an artistic attempt to capture and evoke the sensorial complexities of past events, claiming them as genealogical landmarks in our current collective life.   
=520  \\$aRosa Luisa Márquez (www.marquezmartorell.org) is a Puerto Rican theater artist and pedagogue. Founding member of the theater group Anamú in 1971, she holds a master's degree from New York University and a Doctorate from Michigan State University; she specializes in contemporary theater.

In conjunction with Puerto Rican visual artist Antonio Martorell, she created the concept of Itinerant Performers (1987-1990) resulting in twelve productions.   
=520  \\$aPublished books include "Brincos y saltos: el juego como disciplina teatral" and "Historias para ser contadas, montaje de Rosa Luisa Márquez". She is a member of the board of directors and pedagogical team for the EITALCs International School of Latin American and Caribbean Theater.

=520  \\$aFor several years Indian Summer at the American Community House has been initiated by Inti Raymi, as an attempt to breakdown the borders between indigenous peoples in the Americas. Inti Raymi or sun festival is an annual Incan festival celebrating the winter solstice by marking the return of the sun, which provides food, life and health. Members of the Muyuy Cultural Center in New York City shared this celebration by performing music and dance. The video includes a short Coatlicue Theater Company performance, a demonstration of a hoop dance and other musical acts. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city. AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto neighborhood serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area. 
=520  \\$aThe Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICHs Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICHs visual and performing arts department programs. Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badgers Corner.   
=520  \\$aIndian Summer is an annual event at AICH and an occasion for artists to present their latest works to the community and the general public. All performers, whether new to the field or veteran practitioners, are encouraged to present their work.

=520  \\$a'El Parque Japonés' (premiered in 1997, and nominated for the ACE award in 1998) is a circus operetta performed by the community theater group Catalinas Sur from the La Boca neighborhood of Buenos Aires. The Japanese Park was an amusement park that welcomed migrants on their arrival in Argentina. The piece is less a historical recreation than an affectionate tribute to the popular artists and characters of the 'circo criollo' (like Pepino del 88), film (like King Kong) and television (like wrestler El Hombre de la Barra de Hielo), who, with their itinerant arts, brightened up the lives of La Boca's parents, grandparents, great grandparents, great-great grandparents... The idea of Grupo de Teatro Catalinas Sur (www.catalinasur.com.ar) came to life during a neighborhood barbeque held by a school's parents association in 1983. It was during the time of Argentina's military dictatorship, which stifled popular expression, and the theater group used its community service as a form of resistance that strengthened feelings of solidarity and mutual binding. The group remains rooted in its Buenos Aires neighborhood, even as its membership and fame has grown, performing in a converted warehouse. Catalinas Sur members are acknowledged followers of the traditional artistic forms performed in the quarter which has been the birthplace of the popular arts: puppeteers, musicians, actors, artists originating from the old continent or from Latin America and who mingled their art, like a crucible, with the neighborhood. Firm believers that society can be changed by teamwork and a sense of community, Catalinas Sur has created more than 20 plays and, sweeping aside all false generation gaps, has now over 300 actors. In their own words, 'with the advent of this globalized and inhumane millennium, we are attempting, through the theater, to remember the value of our individual and collective histories, and revive the memory that believed and believes in a better world.'

=520  \\$a'Guinnaru' tells the story of a water spirit coming from Africa to the Pacific coast of Colombia. It elaborates on short stories from an anthology of African oral tradition by Swiss poet and novelist Blaise Cendrars. The play's three parts - 'Mbongo', 'Entremés del Muerto', and 'El Munú del Falemé' - are woven by multiple narrators that sing and tell a series of tales on the intricate relationships between gods, humans and animals. The play merges classic theatrical language with music, dance, acrobatics, masks and colorful costumes in a theatrical exploration of African modes of representation and expression; Black Africans constitute one of the ethnic groups of Colombia and TEC has always tried to rescue and redeem the roots of Colombian national identity. Teatro Experimental de Cali (TEC) is a collective of playwrights, actors, dancers, musicians, stage designers and students committed to the exploration and creation of new languages for Latin American theater. Founded in Colombia in 1955 by Enrique Buenaventura and a group of students at the Instituto Departamental de Bellas Artes, TEC has had a long and fruitful trajectory; their artistic and theoretical work has revolutionized the way that theater is conceived and practiced in Latin America. A key contribution to the field is their method of 'creación colectiva' ('collective creation'), in which all the participants of the play - including the audience - become involved with the dramatic text and its staging. In spite of this stress on collective work, TEC had in Enrique Buenaventura its main poet and playwright, who developed most of TEC's texts and directed the majority of their plays. While TEC's works address various historical and social issues, artistic quality is not sacrificed for the sake of political radicalism. TEC has thus created a theater that is politically and culturally engaged, poetic and innovative without losing its popular appeal.

=520  \\$aThis play has been part of TEC's repertoire since 1958. It is based on a short story by Don Tomás Carrasquilla, which elaborates on a widespread Latin American folk tale. Peralta, the main character, is a peasant, a mythical figure that represents Colombian identity against all earthly, heavenly and infernal powers. He is a gambler, but he is a generous gambler, a Robin Hood-like character who shares everything he earns with the poorest among his neighbors. Jesus and Saint Peter come down to earth in order to test Peralta's honesty. As he passes the test, Jesus grants him four wishes. He uses them to help the peasants against the landlords, the King and the Devil. At the end, Peralta becomes as tiny as an ant and comes to sit on Jesus' right shoulder ('a la diestra de Dios Padre') as his good-hearted advisor. This play is an excellent example of how 'creación colectiva' (collective creation), as a creative method, works for TEC: the piece was reworked several times, transformed by audience interaction and the TEC's ongoing exploration of their repertoire. Teatro Experimental de Cali (TEC) is a collective of artists committed to the exploration and creation of new languages for Latin American theater. Founded in Colombia in 1955 by Enrique Buenaventura and a group of students at the Instituto Departamental de Bellas Artes, TEC has had a long and fruitful trajectory; their artistic and theoretical work has revolutionized the way that theater is conceived and practiced in Latin America.. In spite of this stress on collective work, TEC had in Enrique Buenaventura its main poet and playwright, who developed most of TEC's texts and directed the majority of their plays.

=520  \\$aSusana Cook (www.susanacook.com) is a New York-based Argentinean theater and performance artist. Mainly directed to queer and Latino communities in New York City, Cook's work also encompasses a heated response to broader State policies that oppress communities defined in the intersection of race, gender, and class. In her shows, Cook parodies discourses of power, drawing attention to the close ties between the state, religious and political conservatism, and the military. Cook's plays usually feature all-women casts that defy the normative performance of gender, race, and sexuality. Her piece 'Butch Fashion Show in the Femme Auto Body Shop' was performed at Dixon Pace in the context of the HOT Festival in July, 1997. The performance, a collaboration between Susana and artist Lisa Haas, is comprised of scenes previously worked for a cabaret by Cook's Tango Lesbiango company called 'The Service Economy Vaudeville.' It is a witty, satirical exploration of the ups, downs, and sexual charades at play in an urban butch-femme relationship.

=520  \\$aHugh Danforth, (Oneida from Wisconsin) and Toni Tsatoke, (Kiowa) provide storytelling and other entertainment for the 49ers Elders Luncheon. The 49ers Elders Luncheon is a monthly event sponsored by the American Indian Community House Health Department to allow community Elders, who are often unable to regularly attend other AICH functions to maintain a close relationship with the community and enjoy an entertaining luncheon. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city. AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto neighborhood serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area. The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICHs Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICHs visual and performing arts department programs. Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badgers Corner.

=520  \\$aA co-production of Teatro La Máscara (Colombia) and Bekereke Antzerki Taldea (Basque Country), 'A Flor de Piel' is a Latin-feminine performance about sexuality from a feminine point of view. Four women meet at a bar, sharing their romantic and erotic dreams and stories between drinks, love letters, and pop quiz questions on love and sex. Abandoning traditional social certainties in order to explore personal doubts and contradictions, the characters submerge in the subjectivity of their consciences, setting free their instincts, sensuality, beauty, pleasure. Through this play, La Máscara evidences the extent to which it is still taboo to talk about feminine sexuality from a feminine perspective in Colombian theater. Teatro La Máscara is the oldest - and one of the only - feminist, all-women's theater in Colombia. Founded in 1972 in Cali, La Máscara was a political theater initially comprised of male as well as female actors; by the early 1980s, when only the women stayed and wanted to continue the theatrical trajectory of the group, Lucy Bolaños decided to make La Máscara a women's ensemble fully dedicated to a feminine dramaturgy on gender issues. Committed to feminism and social change, they have stayed true to this mission, despite the many social and economic pressures they've had to endure in an environment plagued by violence and machismo, which constantly seeks to 'invisibilize' their work. Because of their fruitful stubbornness, La Máscara is not only creating and staging plays, but also working with marginalized communities, actively participating in political protests and demonstrations, and being involved in the organization of theater festivals. Through their work, they keep re-thinking women's role in the construction of a peaceful Colombia.

=520  \\$aInspired by Vladimir Nabokov's novel 'Invitation to a Beheading', the play follows the last moments of a man condemned to death penalty. He is going to be beheaded but he does not know when. The prisoner is obsessed with the date of his execution and asks every visitor about this. Everybody, including the warden, hides this information from him. The prisoner is alternatively visited by the warden's daughter, his own mother, a new inmate, and by the warden; even a group of ghosts or visions haunts him. Amidst the nightmarish, carnivalesque ebbs and flows of visitors, the protagonist acts as a deluded philosopher. He alternates obsessive references to the date of his execution with deep (albeit weird) philosophical reflections. Faithful to their traditional exploration of marginal subjects, La Candelaria chooses as main character a true anti-hero, an underdog trapped in the power games of society. La Candelaria was founded in 1966 by a group of independent artists and intellectuals who came from experimental theater and the broader Colombian cultural movement. Directed by Santiago García, La Candelaria (www.teatrolacandelaria.org.co) is one of Colombian theater's most innovative agents, modernizing national drama while addressing popular audiences. By means of an ongoing exploration of national folklore, situations and characters, they have created some of Colombia's most compelling plays, some of them through the method of 'creación colectiva' ('collective creation'), addressing the acute social and political problems of their society. At the same time, they fostered the creation of Corporación Colombiana del Teatro and have developed a number of theoretical works that reflect upon dramatic creation, its methods and languages. Still nowadays, La Candelaria is committed to repertoire, experimentation, and discussion as fundamental elements to artistic creation.

=520  \\$aThis unedited handheld video footage documents a series of performance interventions with the audience, as a part of Pocha Nostra's performance 'The Dangerous Border Game', a 'culti-multural, end-of-the-century, post-NAFTA, freak show extravaganza' exploring pressing cross-cultural, border-crossing issues on multicultural fears and desires, stereotypes, diversity and identity. The performers asked the audience to assist dressed up as their favorite 'cultural other'; a crew of San Francisco Art Institute students documented this open call on 'cultural transvestism', interviewing the audience as they arrived to the theater. La Pocha Nostra (www.pochanostra.com) is an ever-morphing trans-disciplinary arts organization, founded in 1993 by Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Roberto Sifuentes, and Nola Mariano in California. The objective was to formally conceptualize Gómez-Peña's collaborations with other performance artists. 
=520  \\$aIt provides a base (and forum) for a loose network of rebel artists from various disciplines, generations and ethnic backgrounds, whose common denominator is the desire to cross and erase dangerous borders between art and politics, practice and theory, artist and spectator. As of June 2006, members include performance artists Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Violeta Luna, Michelle Ceballos, and Roberto Sifuentes; curators Gabriela Salgado and Orlando Britto; and over thirty associates worldwide in countries such as Mexico, Spain, the UK, and Australia. Projects range from performance solos and duets to large-scale performance installations including video, photography, audio, and cyber-art. La Pocha collaborates across national borders, race, gender and generations. Their collaborative model functions both as an act of citizen diplomacy and as a means to create ephemeral communities of like-minded rebels.   
=520  \\$aThe basic premise of these collaborations is founded on an ideal: If we learn to cross borders on stage, we may learn how to do so in larger social spheres. La Pocha strives to eradicate myths of purity and dissolve borders surrounding culture, ethnicity, gender, language, and métier. These are radical acts.

=520  \\$aThe American Indian Community House (AICH) presents the internationally acclaimed Jones Benally Family Dance Troupe (Navajo/Diné). The Mesa, Arizona troupe visited the Community House to perform in its Circle where they presented traditional Navajo and inter-tribal dances to the AICH community. The Jones Benally Family Dance Troupe is led by Jones Benally, a world champion hoop dancer, and includes his three grandchildren, who also perform with their politically driven punk rock band Blackfire. With a repertoire of over two dozen Navajo and Inter-Tribal dances, the Troupe has performed in the United States, Europe, South America and Canada, as well as for many Indian Nations. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city. AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto neighborhood serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area. The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICHs Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICHs visual and performing arts department programs. Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badgers Corner.

=520  \\$aThis production, in collaboration with the Working Women Festival, is a play that explores Virgin, Mother, Whore mythology and stereotypes. Body types and image topics are questioned: What does a Virgin look like? A Whore? A Latina? From where do we get these ideas? Is there a God? A Goddess? And why are all Latinas expected to know how to salsa dance??? Latina Theatre Lab was one of the first and only all-Latina collective of writers, performers, and directors in the U.S. Their performance-sketch work dealt with pop culture, immigration, cross-cultural identities, and the complexities of 'being Latina.' The group was founded in 1994 by four San Francisco Bay Area actresses: Dena Martinez, Jaime Lujan, Tessa Koning-Martinez and Wilma Bonet. Their purpose was to create theater that would go beyond the ever shrinking and limited range of roles for which Latina actresses were being considered. These roles were scarce, and rarely defied stereotypes. From 1994-1999, Latina Theatre Lab's work played with these cultural and gender stereotypes, exploring the legacies they inherited both as Latinas and as women. They also collaborated with fellow comedy troupes in California, such as Culture Clash, the Asian American Theater Company, and the 18 Mighty Mountain Warriors.

If chance had not willed otherwise': Pozzo's line from Samuel Beckett's 'Waiting for Godot' gives the audience clues through which to decipher the coordinates of Rosa Luisa Márquez rendition of this Theater of the Absurd masterpiece. Adapted to the Puerto Rican reality, this play places the audience onstage, witnessing the games, confrontations and exchanges between homeless characters that unfold, double, repeat and change hats under a tree made up of recycled materials and junk, haunted by a an eerie sea of empty theater seats, torn between hope and despair waiting. Rosa Luisa Márquez (www.marquezmartorell.org) is a Puerto Rican theater artist and pedagogue. Founding member of the theater group Anamú in 1971, she holds a Master's degree from New York University and a Doctorate from Michigan State University; she specializes in contemporary theater. Rosa Luisa started her teaching career at the Theater department of the University of Puerto Rico in 1978. She developed the current curriculum of Drama Activities, which she teaches in her workshops at schools, prisons, rehab centers, women's shelters, nursing homes and community centers. Her directing projects include 'Romeo(s) y Julieta(s),' 'Historias para ser Contadas,' 'La Leyenda del Cemí,' 'Procesión,' 'Waiting for Godot,' 'Jardín de Pulpos,' 'Absurdos en Soledad,' 'El León y la Joya,' among others. In conjunction with Puerto Rican visual artist Antonio Martorell, she created the concept of Itinerant Performers (1987-1990) resulting in twelve productions. Published books include 'Brincos y saltos: el juego como disciplina teatral' and 'Historias para ser contadas, montaje de Rosa Luisa Márquez.' She is a member of the board of directors and pedagogical team for the EITALC's International School of Latin American and Caribbean Theater. Ongoing artistic collaborators include Gilda Navarra and Antonio Martorell (Puerto Rico), Grupo Malayerba (Ecuador), Grupo Yuyachkani (Peru), and directors Peter Shumann (Bread & Puppet Theater, U.S.A.) and Augusto Boal (Theater of the Oppressed, Brazil).

=520  \\$aIn 'se parece a la felicidad,' renowned Cuban artist Manuel Mendive orchestrates a massive performance event, combining visual arts, music, dance, performance art, Afro-Cuban elements and 200 hundred bodies painted to represent the sky, the sea, and the land. In this performance, brightly-colored bodies streak through the streets of Havana, shouting and gesturing wildly, dancing in sync, carrying ducks. Aaron Vega's video documents this exuberant public body art performance, including scenes of Mendive's unique method of preparing the performers: painting some with bright animals and abstract shapes, and covering others entirely in one color. Manuel Mendive Hoyo (www.mendive.cult.cu) is perhaps the single most important Cuban artist today. Mendive, a major exponent of contemporary 'Afro-cubanismo' in the visual arts, was born in 1944 into a Santería-practicing family. He graduated from the prestigious Academia de Artes Plásticas San Alejandro in Havana in 1962 with honors in sculpture and painting. He held his first one-man show at the Center of Art in Havana in 1964. Since then he has exhibited in some of the most important international venues. The Cuban booth at the XLII International Biennial Exhibition of Modern Art in Venice in 1988 was completely dedicated to his works. His work can be found in Museums and galleries in many countries including the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes in Havana, the Musee d'Art Moderne in Paris; as well as museums in Russia, Somalia, Congo, Norway, Denmark, Finland and the U.S and other countries. He is well-known not only for his painting and soft sculpture, but for his performance pieces in which he paints dancers' naked bodies and creates theatrical backdrops and environments. Representing an important strain of Cuban life, Mendive's multi-media work reflects his syncretic take on religion, philosophy, ethnography, art and dance.

=520  \\$aIn this cabaret performance, Jesusa Rodríguez poses a satiric comment on the commodification of the posthumous image of Eva Duarte de Perón by literature, film, and pop culture. In a direct comment on the American musical 'Evita,' Rodríguez proposes an 'alternative' history of Duarte de Perón's final days and the ultimate disposal of her corpse, playfully clashing historic, real, fictional, virtual and anachronistic conceptions of time and place. 'In the face of Latin America's current social, economic, and political crisis, in an era of globalization and profound impasses, we can't help but ask ourselves a pressing question: who was Eva Perón, and what happened to her corpse?': a satiric comment on Western society's priorities, meshed with original and traditional tangos and milongas (performed by 'el Gaucho del Wonder Bra' Liliana Felipe), these questions articulate the piece as a set of three interconnected skits. The performance starts with a radio show featuring biographies of key female public figures in Latin America (sponsored by 'Jabón Radical' ('Radical Soap,' which 'cleans and reestablishes social order'). The second segment is the enacted story of the 'final events' in Evita's life: Eva (performed by Rodríguez) bought a radio station to counteract her detractors' versions of her life and death, and 'reenacts' her final days with the aid of her mother (who is about to give birth to President Carlos Menem, and wants to get the access code to Evita's bank accounts), a nurse, and a foley assistant. The third and final skit takes us to a Mexico City's Customs office, where corruption, drug dealing, and political coups brew, resulting in a change of government that intends to use Evita's body (held in customs on its way to the U.S., where Madonna intended to use it as a promotional object for her movie) as sorts of flag for the 'incorruptibility' of the new 'national body.' Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodréguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a chameleon, Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her espectáculos (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and carpa, to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguezs energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: I am going to die with that woman. Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. In this off-off space, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas, Jesusa y Liliana have produced hundreds of shows since the 1980s.

=520  \\$aIn this street/cabaret performance, La Chinga, a Mexican ensemble that explores popular archetypes present in the collective imagery, rooted in the tradition of XIX-century satiric lithography, turns the traditional theater genre of the 'pastorela' (Nativity play) on its head. The resulting 'partorela' (a pun for 'parto' or 'delivery,' 'birth,' 'enlightenment') presents La China (impersonation of Mexico City by Jesusa Rodríguez), about to give birth to 'El Niño' (a climate phenomenon? The Blessed Child?) at 'a hermeneutic and metaphysical crossroads': Mexico City's subway system. In a satiric reenactment and actualization of Mexican archetypes in the context of current sociopolitical events, La China's uterus is stolen in a convergence of police brutality, political corruption, the involvement of a militaristic Church, all wrapped in satiric, underdog picaresque. A heated debate arises on the baby's fate as characters El Maromero (the corrupted politician), El Cura (the corrupted Church) and El Pulque (Mexican folk inspiration and wisdom) each has in his power an element of China's 'extrauterine pregnancy': the uterus (stolen by El Maromero), the zygote (destined by El Cura to have a 'moral' delivery), and the shadow (or 'soul,' in the custody of El Pulque). In order to recover her pregnancy's constituting parts, La China has to get involved with the campaigns of candidates to the Secretary of Education, the Ministry of Culture, the Secretary of Treasury, and the Presidency in the upcoming Mexican elections. After recovering the parts, and with the aid of El Pulque, La China gives birth to El Niño (a big-headed baby), who in his 'intrauterine gibberish' -simultaneously translated by La China- asks the audience for petitions to be considered in his candidacy for the Presidency of Mexico. The Army, the Corrupted Politician and the militarized Church, who had before manipulated, puppet-like, an effigy of President Ernesto Zedillo in a satiric song on military interventions in Chenhaló, Chiapas, end up crucifying El Niño, leaving open the question of what will happen in the next presidential elections. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodríguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a chameleon, Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her espectáculos (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and carpa, to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguez's energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics.

=520  \\$aLa Chinga is a Mexican theater company devoted to the development of an itinerant, populist, inclusive, journalistic street performance ensemble. It intends to explore, recuperate and document the corporeal, vocal and musical characteristics of Mexico's popular archetypes present in the collective imagery and rooted in the tradition of satiric lithography as developed at the end of the XIX century by artists like José María Villasana, Daniel Cabrera, José Guadalupe Posada and Constantino Escalante, among others. The result, a sorts of Mexican Commedia dell'Arte -with improvisational twists and turns aiming to evidence vices in social conduct- is less an archaeological 'reconstruction' than a humorous, satiric reenactment and actualization of these archetypes in the context of current sociopolitical events in the public sphere. Some archetypical characters -depicted in masks created by Sheila Goloborotko- are: 'El Hijo del Ahuizote' (the persecuted and censored journalist), 'Doña Caralampia Mondongo' (the spirit of criticism), 'Don Catrín de la Fachenda' (the pretentious deceiver), 'La Jamona' (the socialite old maid, stalker of young men), 'El Dictador' (the figure of power and authoritarism), 'El Padre Cobos' (the anticlericalist), 'El Maromero' (the exploitative politician who, no matter what, is always back on his feet), 'El Lépero' (the eternal underdog, the moral contagium), 'El Pulque' (the folkloric embodiment of inspiration), 'El Pelado' (the builder of the nation), 'La China' (the brave townswoman), and 'El Cuico' (the roguish policeman). The cast is conformed by Liliana Felipe, Bibiana Goday, Flor Eduarda Gurrola, Diego Jáuregui, Clarissa Malheiros, Andrés Loewe, Diego Luna, Tito Vasconcelos, and Jesusa Rodríguez. This documentary video is a sorts of presentational, introductory manifesto of the La Chinga project. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodríguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a chameleon, Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her espectáculos (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and carpa, to performative acts within political projects.

She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguez's energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics.

=520  \\$aRather than lock Chekhov's 'Three Sisters' into its own or any other single period, the production moves through time. The first act, performed realistically, takes place in 1901 in a provincial Russian town. The action centers around the 22nd birthday party of Irina, the youngest sister and the arrival in town of the handsome officer, Colonel Vershinin. The second act is staged in biomechanical style, as the Russian director Vsevolod Meyerhold might have done in the early 1920s, the high point of Soviet revolutionary aspirations. The stage is bare except for two benches, a couch, and a piano. The actors sing Red Army songs. The third act takes place in the 1950s in a Siberian labor camp. The prisoners enact Chekhov's play as they build walls of cinder blocks. The last act takes place in the here and now of the theater. The performers, speaking through microphones, address the audience directly. In the background, fragments of dialogue from the previous acts are spoken in an undertone. The sisters' dream of returning to Moscow has been shattered; the love affairs have ended. As the sisters wonder what their suffering means, the old doctor Chebutykin mutters, 'It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter.' Though performed mostly in English, Chekhov's Russian text is also heard as the role of Anfisa is played entirely in that language by Michele Minnick who translated the play from Russian. The cast also performs a number of East European songs from the 19th and 20th centuries. In this production, East Coast Artists test and explore the relevance of 'Three Sisters' as drama, physical theater, fear and hope in desperate times, farce, and soap-opera. Richard Schechner is a theater director, performance theorist and university professor known for being one of the founders of the academic discipline of Performance Studies at Tisch School of the Arts, New York University. Schechner combines his work in anthropology with innovative approaches to performance of all kinds including ritual, drama, environmental theater, political rallies, dance, music, etc. in order to consider how performance can be understood not just as an object of study, but also as an active intellectual-artistic practice. He is the editor of 'TDR: The Journal of Performance Studies.' His books include 'Environmental Theater,' 'The Future of Ritual,' 'Performance Theory,' 'Between Theater and Anthropology' and 'Performance Studies: An Introduction.' As of 2007, his books have been translated into 14 languages.

=520  \\$aAdaptation written by Raquel Carrió and Flora Lauten, based on texts by Shakespeare, Carpentier, Paz, Martí, and Caribbean folktales, rituals and songs from Yoruban and Araran cultures. An exploration of the conflicting and syncretic coordinates of "cubanidad", Otra Tempestad tells the story of the labyrinthical encounters (dreamt or imagined) between well-known Shakespearean characters and key figures of Afro-Caribbean mythology. Fifteen "cuadros", constantly cycling from death to utopia to death, examine archetypal behavior, investigating the space where worlds collide, the confluence of old and new world orders. Teatro Buendía, formed in 1986 by graduates from the Higher Institute of Arts, Havana, and directed by Flora Lauten, is Cuba's most celebrated theater company. Since its foundation, they have developed two parallel lines of work: the production of theater spectacles, and a permanent research center investigating Latin American and Caribbean cultural traditions, the expressive possibilities of the actor, and the renewal of scenic languages. The study of the possible relations between music, dance, and interpretation, as well as the formulation of new forms of scenic writing and dramaturgy of the spectacle, has consolidated Teatro Buendía's international prestige as a company that has presented their repertoire in the most demanding festivals and venues of Latin America, Europe, North America, Asia, Africa and Australia, all to critical acclaim. They also tour internationally giving workshops, seminars and conferences on their cultural investigations and creative methods.

=520  \\$aFounded in 1965 by Luis Valdez, El Teatro Campesino was initially the cultural wing of the United Farm Workers union in California's central valley. With a pointed political mission, ETC performed their actos in the fields, agitprop improvisations communicated eloquently with the workers, who could neither read nor write, but recognized themselves and their values in the actos. By 1970 ETC had gained an international reputation, with major contributions to Chicano culture in the U.S. and to the development and expansion of the boundaries of theater everywhere. Theirs is a popular theater rooted in the American streets, early California history, Mayan/Aztec mythology and Mexican folklore and spiritualism, all geared toward expression of social, political and cultural perceptions. This video documents ETCs piece The Cenci. After studying the theory of French theater practitioner Antonin Artaud and his conceptualization of Theater of Cruelty (which emphasized the importance of gesture and the physical as its own expressive language and also challenged concepts of reality vs. perception), Kinan Valdez adapted Percy Bysshe Shelleys play The Cenci (1819), which Artaud staged. In this controversial play, inspired by a real Italian family (the Cencis, in particular, Beatrice Cenci), the Cenci family conspires to assassinate the father figure in an attempt to stop his reign of terror, torture, rape and incest. The father unveils the conspiracy, with tragic, fatal consequences. It is a very dark piece that applies the Teatro Campesino aesthetic to Shelleys script, adding a highly physicalized visual score to a text-heavy piece, which also mirrors Artauds physically-based theatrical style. According to director Kinan Valdez, the play was not well-received by the ETC audiences because of its controversial themes.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of Puerto Rican experimental dance performance ‘Riversa,’ choreographed by Viveca Vázquea, a choreographer, dancer, and a professor of humanities and contemporary dance for actors at the University of Puerto Rico. She presented her first work with Pisotón, the first experimental dance group of Puerto Rico and, shortly after, Taller de Otra Cosa, of which she became the first director. Through the company she presented her choreographic work and produced events such as ‘Rompeforma’ a key festival in the development of the experimental dance and performance scene in Puerto Rico, which was co-produced with Puerto Rican choreographer based in the U.S. Merian Soto. Since 1984 she has produced and performed experimental dance works in the United States, Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina, among a great number of other places. As a teacher she has developed a pedagogical model based on body conscience and improvisation. ‘Riversa’ intends to delineate Viveca Vázquez’ own style, and to show her origins in exploring the absurdity of the movements and proposing dance as a way of thinking. On stage, the individual body and the collective body are in dialogue and conflict at the same time, as their movements oscillate between flow and struggling, sound and silence, immobility and movement. The questions proposed are: what is a body? How to make the body ‘fit’ into pre-notions of shape, movement, and even ‘choreography’? In exploring these questions Viveca Vázquez has developed what she calls ‘Choreography of the Error’ -- based on quotidian movements and diverse bodies, Vázquez challenges the audience’s expectations of what should be performed on stage. At the same time, she problematizes what is conceived as a ‘Puerto Rican body’: is this pure physicality or it is a political construction?

They are performers, playwrights, and teachers who tour their work in their communities and internationally, performing plays that focus on women's and indigenous rights, literacy, cultural survival, ecology, health, and education in the Tzeltal and Tzotzil indigenous languages. 'Conchita desconchada' tells the story of Conchita, an elderly woman in search of a home. The word- play in the title references the lack of shelter that the protagonist, Conchita, suffers after she is thrown out of the house that she shares with her daughter and her husband (in Spanish the word 'concha' means 'shell' and the prefix 'des' means 'deprived.') The piece narrates Conchita's pilgrimage from a small town to the city, to which she arrives in search of her son, who rejects her. She then meets a woman who offers her a job as a caretaker of her father. Finally, it is Conchita's granddaughter who takes care of her and brings her back to Conchita's son's house as she is thrilled to learn about her roots and to re-connect with her community.

=520  \\$aIn ‘Looking In/To The Future,’ the New WORLD Theater worked with young people in the Khmer, Vietnamese, Latina/o, and African-American communities surrounding Amherst, Massachusetts to help them define their cultural identities through writing and theatre activities. In this workshop final presentation, a group of young performers discuss their social, cultural, and class backgrounds. Speaking in their many languages, we get a glimpse into the characters’ lives in a school setting, expressing their parents’ expectations for their future, and their cultural legacy of the past. They also engage with games, and while performing their ‘animal personalities,’ they reflect upon their land, nature, and village. By the end of the play, the young performers come out on stage and collectively state the message ‘Were going to a place where we can make a new world.’ This video documentation features a brief Q&A with the performers.
=520  \\$aFrom 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a ‘new world’ - one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting demographics. From a geographic ‘outpost’ in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, methods, and production. One of New WORLD Theater’s artistic legacies is Project 2050, an early call to imagine the U.S. demographic shift, with people of the future - youth, in equal collaboration with artists and scholars.

The moon also gives birth to the devil who curses the world and changes everything for the worse. Because people get organized and help each other, they finally defeat the devil and his dragon. The aftermath of the devil's death is a beautiful day in which a series of rights are honored and enjoyed - land, health, education, work, housing, etc.

=520  \\$a'Quinceañera' is a video documentation of a performance created collaboratively to address the 15th anniversary of the AIDS pandemic. As a collaborative creation, these stories can be read not only like personal stories, but also as the stories of a community. Alberto Antonio Araiza, Paul Bonin-Rodriguez, and Michael Marínez worked together in community-based activism, and create a multi-disciplinary performance piece that involves storytelling, ritual, performance and visual arts. For this reason, 'Quinceañera' transits between the cheerfulness of a creative process and the engagement with a topic that is full of fear and sorrow. The ghost of AIDS permeates relations between persons and their own traditions, stories, and histories. Particularly, the social ritual of the 'quinceañera'- the debutante party reserved for young girls in Spanish-speaking communities - becomes a space of contesting gender and sexuality roles. At the same time that the piece reveals how rituals are gendered, it also highlights how affective responses to pop culture can be understood as newer familiar traditions. The role of Spanish language, unapologetically spoken in the piece, underlines the fact that gender, ethnicity, and race are intertwined in social marginalization. Along with an honest and strong affirmation of race and sexuality, the virus that marks the body signals identity and belonging. The three male characters explain how AIDS affected gay population, and the discrimination that comes with the epidemic. The group of men breaks into songs advocating for justice for all people infected with AIDS, and the entire queer community. The video documentation also features a talk back with the performers and the audience members.

=520  \\$a1998 version of the by now traditional murga 'La Catalina del Riachuelo,' performed by the community theater group Catalinas Sur of the La Boca neighborhood in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Staged since 1992 and adapted to each year's sociopolitical climate, the piece poses a carnivalesque critique of current local political events and social issues. La Catalina del Riachuelo's songs, storytelling and humorous skits compose a satirical commentary on politics and politicians, power and the powerful, and events of national (and international) repercussion. Political corruption, police brutality, environmental pollution, and unemployment are some of the topics discussed in the piece, presented as the downside of globalization and 'Progress.' Historically, carnival - and the local tradition of the Rioplatense 'murga' - has been a space for the transgression and critique of the rules of the leading classes by the popular imaginary. 'La Catalina del Riachuelo' is conceived as a tribute to this Argentinean popular tradition. It is both a critique of society's political maladies and a celebration of hope, love and the honoring of cultural heritage as social antidotes to these problems, as cohesive forces giving a sense of community to the inhabitants of La Boca. The idea of Grupo de Teatro Catalinas Sur (www.catalinasur.com.ar) came to life during a neighborhood barbeque held by a school's parents association in 1983. It was during the time of Argentina's military dictatorship, which stifled popular expression, and the theater group used its community service as a form of resistance that strengthened feelings of solidarity and mutual binding. The group remains rooted in its Buenos Aires neighborhood, even as its membership and fame has grown, performing in a converted warehouse. Catalinas Sur members are acknowledged followers of the traditional artistic forms performed in the quarter which has been the birthplace of the popular arts: puppeteers, musicians, actors, artists originating from the old continent or from Latin America and who mingled their art, like a crucible, with the neighborhood. Firm believers that society can be changed by teamwork and a sense of community, Catalinas Sur has created more than 20 plays and, sweeping aside all false generation gaps, has now over 300 actors. In their own words, 'with the advent of this globalized and inhumane millennium, we are attempting, through the theater, to remember the value of our individual and collective histories, and revive the memory that believed and believes in a better world.'

=520  \\$aSusana Cook (www.susanacook.com) is a New York-based Argentinean theater and performance artist. Mainly directed to queer and Latino communities in New York City, Cook's work also encompasses a heated response to broader State policies that oppress communities defined in the intersection of race, gender, and class. In her shows, Cook parodies discourses of power, drawing attention to the close ties between the state, religious and political conservatism, and the military. Cook's plays usually feature all-women casts that defy the normative performance of gender, race, and sexuality. During his administration, Rudolph Giuliani, the Mayor of New York City, decided that he was going to 'exterminate' the rats from New York City. In 'Rats' Susana Cook used some of Giuliani's discourse to compare it with the fantasy that some people have to make gays and lesbians disappear; the fantasy that those in power have that they can exterminate and rend any minority group invisible. 'Rats' is about queers, butches, lesbians, and a little bit about rats. The show has a non linear structure. The piece starts with a comparison between rats and King Hamlet. The main character realizes that she already became a ghost - even when she is not dead yet - and she starts obsessing about her ghost and her death. She states: 'sometimes your death can be more important than your life'.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of Mapa Teatro's production of Antonio Orlando Rodríguez's theater piece 'El león y la domadora.' In this play, two characters - immigrants, dreamers - leave their homeland in search of prosperity and fortune. But, as with any migration fueled by a dream, their lives are torn between the reality of all that was lost and the illusion of all that may come. One of the foremost artistic companies in Colombia, Mapa Teatro (www.mapateatro.org) has been producing theater, performance and art installation projects since 1984. Founders and directors, Rolf and Heidi Abderhalden have created a wide ranging repertoire of theater, opera, mixed-media performance, and site-specific installation. Their work proposes richly textured visual metaphors in which they consider often complex psychological, social and political relationships. Committed to experimentation, and less interested in the actor as an 'agent of fiction,' they describe their project as 'a laboratory of social imagination,' that offers a space for presenting community issues and human concerns in media and performance. This combination of real-life situations and sites along with highly stylized aesthetic staging produces a tension between real action and (re)presentation. Mapa Teatro draws from live events captured on video such as the demolition of a neighborhood in Bogotá, ritual practice, and texts that explore the relationship of postmodern subjects, myth and metaphor. Mapa Teatro has performed by commissions, festivals and collaborative projects world-wide.

=520  \\$aThis documentary, created for the 25th anniversary of Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani, is a must-see for anyone interested in the work of this renowned Peruvian theater group. This documentary features interviews with Miguel Rubio (director of the group), other group members, and several renowned archaeologists, critics and theater experts of Peru, including anthropologist Rodrigo Montoya, historian María Rostworowski, director of the Escuela Internacional de Teatro de América Latina y el Caribe (EITALC), Osvaldo Dragún, and Hugo Salazar, a prominent Peruvian theater critic. The documentary also includes footage of performances 'Músicos Ambulantes', 'Encuentro de Zorros', 'Baladas del Bien-Estar', 'Son de los Diablos', 'Contraelviento', 'Adiós Ayacucho', 'Yuyachkani En Concierto', 'No Me Toquen Ese Valse', 'Hasta Cuándo Corazón', 'Retorno' and 'Pasacalle', all works that the group performed within its first twenty-five years of theater work. The documentary discusses the progression of the group, from an ensemble of young students eager to explore theater, to an integral element of Peruvian society responding to the cultural and political issues of Peru. This documentary shows Yuyachkanis relationship to the community and nicely illustrates the history of the plays and the theater group itself. Perus most important theater collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani (www.yuyachkani.org) has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. Yuyachkani is a Quechua word that means I am thinking, I am remembering; under this name, the theater group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru. The group is comprised of seven actors (Augusto Casafranca, Amiel Cayo, Ana Correa, Débora Correa, Rebeca Ralli, Teresa Ralli, and Julián Vargas), a technical designer (Fidel Melquíades), and an artistic director (Miguel Rubio), who have made a commitment to collective creation as a mode of theatrical production and to group theater as a life style. Their work has been among the most important in Latin Americas so called New Popular Theater, with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy. Yuyachkani won Perus National Human Rights Award in 2000. Known for its creative embrace of both indigenous performance forms as well as cosmopolitan theatrical forms, Yuyachkani offers insight into Peruvian and Latin American theater, and to broader issues of postcolonial social aesthetics.

=520  \\$aA 'political peepshow' of sorts, this interactive performance/installation functions as a living museum of techno-dioramas displaying a series of living 'multicultural Frankensteins' or 'ethno-cyborgs'. The characters, created by La Pocha Nostra, are based on thousands of anonymous on-line responses by net users (www.mexterminator.com), re-interpreting their proposals for 'hybrid specimens' meant to embody Americans' expressed intercultural fears and desires toward Latinos, immigrants and people of color. The resulting dioramas involve physical interaction with the audience, encouraging visitors to engage in the reflection of their own psychological and cultural monsters. La Pocha Nostra (www.pochanostra.com) is an ever-morphing trans-disciplinary arts organization, founded in 1993 by Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Roberto Sifuentes, and Nola Mariano in California. The objective was to formally conceptualize Gómez-Peña's collaborations with other performance artists. It provides a base (and forum) for a loose network of rebel artists from various disciplines, generations and ethnic backgrounds, whose common denominator is the desire to cross and erase dangerous borders between art and politics, practice and theory, artist and spectator. As of June 2006, members include performance artists Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Violeta Luna, Michelle Ceballos, and Roberto Sifuentes; curators Gabriela Salgado and Orlando Britto; and over thirty associates worldwide in countries such as Mexico, Spain, the UK, and Australia. Projects range from performance solos and duets to large-scale performance installations including video, photography, audio, and cyber-art. La Pocha collaborates across national borders, race, gender and generations. Their collaborative model functions both as an act of citizen diplomacy and as a means to create ephemeral communities of like-minded rebels. The basic premise of these collaborations is founded on an ideal: If we learn to cross borders on stage, we may learn how to do so in larger social spheres. La Pocha strives to eradicate myths of purity and dissolve borders surrounding culture, ethnicity, gender, language, and métier. These are radical acts.

=520  \\$aDanny Hoch (www.dannyhoch.com) is an actor, playwright and director whose plays 'Pot Melting', 'Some People', and 'Jails, Hospitals & Hip-Hop' have garnered many awards including 2 OBIES, a NEA Solo Theatre Fellowship, Sundance Writers Fellowship, CalArts/Alpert Award In Theatre and a Tennessee Williams Fellowship. He is a Senior Fellow at the New School's Vera List Center For Art & Politics and his writings on hip-hop, race and class have appeared in 'The Village Voice' and 'New York Times', among others; his book 'Jails, Hospitals & Hip-Hop' is in its second printing by Villard Books/Random House. Mr. Hoch also founded the 'Hip-Hop Theater Festival' in 2000 which has since presented over 75 hip-hop generation plays from all over the world. A third-generation New Yorker who grew up during the birth of hip-hop culture in a multiracial outer-borough neighborhood, Danny brings together his inner monologues, layered composites of stories and voices form his personal experiences, stories of his community and his generation, placing traditionally peripheral characters center stage. Characters like prison convicts Bronx and Andy; 'gangsta thug'-wannabe white teenager Flip; correction officer with anger management problems Sam; Gabriel, a young man with a severe speech disorder due to his mother's drug addiction during pregnancy; Victor, a young man on permanent steel crutches because of police brutality; young Cuban student Peter; and successful rapper Emcee Enuff, all evidence this outstanding contemporary work, reunited under the title 'Jails, Hospitals & Hip-Hop', here performed at Performance Space 122 in New York City. An urban griot for the communities of urban North America, Hoch combines hip-hop culture's worldview and expressive strategies of resistance along with storytelling riffs, actively exploring language in order to move the audience from passive entertainment to active engagement.

=520  \\$aThe humped-back flute player known by the Hopi word Kokopelli is an ancient deity and today, one of the Hopi Kachinas. Kokopelli is a symbol of fertility in many Native cultures and is thought to bring well-being to the people, assuring success in hunting, planting and growing crops, and human conception. His 'hump' is often considered a bag of gifts, a sack carrying the seeds of plants and flowers he scatters every spring. Kokopelli is the inspiration for 'Old Man Kokopelli', a Gateway Performance Production performed by John Jaramillo and Sandra Hughes. This performance was one of the many guest performances from outside the New York area to be welcome into the AICH circle. John Jaramillo conceived, choreographed and directed this production in collaboration with Sandra Hughes, the founding Artistic Director of Gateway Performance Productions, and mask carver Michael Hickey. Both Hughes and Jaramillo have taught the performing arts to Native American Youth at Isleta Pueblo Indian Reservation (NM), Red Lake Indian Reservation (MN), the Riverside Indian School (OK) and for the American Indian Institute's Project L.O.G.I.C. for gifted and talented Native American Youth. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city. AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto 'neighborhood' serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area. The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICH's Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980's, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICH's visual and performing arts department programs. Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform andchallenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badger's Corner.

=520  \\$aAdaptation written by Raquel Carrió and Flora Lauten, based on texts by Shakespeare, Carpentier, Paz, Martí, and Caribbean folktales, rituals and songs from Yoruban and Araran cultures. An exploration of the conflicting and syncretic coordinates of "cubanidad", Otra Tempestad tells the story of the labyrinthical encounters (dreamt or imagined) between well-known Shakespearean characters and key figures of Afro-Caribbean mythology. Fifteen "cuadros", constantly cycling from death to utopia to death, examine archetypal behavior, investigating the space where worlds collide, the confluence of old and new world orders. The performance here documented was staged in the context of "The Season of Justice and Mercy" (1998) at the reconstructed Shakespeare's Globe Theatre in London. Teatro Buendía, formed in 1986 by graduates from the Higher Institute of Arts, Havana, and directed by Flora Lauten, is Cuba's most celebrated theater company. Since its foundation, they have developed two parallel lines of work: the production of theater spectacles, and a permanent research center investigating Latin American and Caribbean cultural traditions, the expressive possibilities of the actor, and the renewal of scenic languages. The study of the possible relations between music, dance, and interpretation, as well as the formulation of new forms of scenic writing and dramaturgy of the spectacle, have consolidated Teatro Buendía's international prestige as a company that has presented their repertoire in the most demanding festivals and venues of Latin America, Europe, North America, Asia, Africa and Australia, all to critical acclaim. They also tour internationally giving workshops, seminars and conferences on their cultural investigations and creative methods.

=520  \\$aLatina Theater Lab developed acting workshops and Ranchera singing classes led by ensemble member Yolanda Aranda, who asked: What kind of music did you listen to at home? As each participant answered the questions, stories began to unfold through songs that evoked a cherished memory or a painful loss. During the eight-week workshop, participants were all required to memorize and perform a song they had chosen in true Ranchera style. This is a video documentation of two developmental workshops where members of the ensemble share their performance composition method with the audience. Latina Theatre Lab was one of the first and only all-Latina collective of writers, performers, and directors in the U.S. Their performance-sketch work dealt with pop culture, immigration, cross-cultural identities, and the complexities of 'being Latina.' It was founded in 1994 by four San Francisco Bay Area actresses: Dena Martinez, Jaime Lujan, Tessa Koning-Martinez and Wilma Bonet. Their purpose was to create theater that would go beyond the ever shrinking and limited range of roles for which Latina actresses were being considered. These roles were scarce, and rarely defied stereotypes. From 1994-1999, Latina Theatre Lab's work played with these cultural and gender stereotypes, exploring the legacies they inherited both as Latinas and as women. They also collaborated with Culture Clash, the Asian American Theater Company, and the 18 Mighty Mountain Warriors.

=511  1\$aCircus Amok.
=520  \\$aVideo documentation of Circus Amok's show, 'Quality of Life,' performed in 1998 in diverse New York City parks, squares and other public spaces. The piece revolves around political, social and economic issues at play in New York City, while posing a critique of the clash between the needs of the diverse, multitudinous population of NYC, and the oppressive governmental policies impacting the city. Poverty, oppressive labor conditions and other economic inequalities, along with police brutality, unequal rights for minorities, political oppression, lack of affordable health services, and excessive construction of corporate and commercial buildings in residential areas (including the demolition of community gardens) are some of the topics here exposed. Through the unveiling of these issues, the piece poses an open call for civic activism and empowerment, a demand for justice and for a revision of the coordinates of NYC civil life, all interwoven in a joyful extravaganza of acrobatic artistry, satiric skill, and good old-fashioned circus fun. Circus Amok (www.circusamok.org) is a New York City based circus-theater company whose mission is to provide free public art addressing contemporary issues of social justice to the people of NYC. Directed and founded by Jennifer Miller, the group has been together since 1989 bringing its funny, queer, caustic and sexy, political one-ring spectacles to diverse neighborhoods throughout the city. Over the years the traditional circus skills - tight rope walking, juggling, acrobatics, stilt walking, clowning - have been combined with experimental dance, lifesize puppetry, music old and new, and gender-bending performance art and improvisational techniques, creating new meanings for circus while continuing to entertain the crowds of all ages throughout the city streets, gardens, parks, and playgrounds, inviting the audience to join them in envisioning a more empowered life of community interaction while enjoying a queer celebratory spectacle.

=520  \\$aMonica 'Lengüinsky' (played by Jesusa Rodríguez) flees to Mexico during the Clinton scandal, becomes a TV writer, and produces 'El Derecho de Abortar,' a show that is a cross between a 'pastorela' (Nativity play) and a 'telenovela' (soap opera). This 'pastonovela' features Virgin Mary and Joseph of Nazareth as two wealthy Mexicans tormented by the ambiguous sexuality of their cross-dressing son, Jesus Christ. In a failed attempt to 'straighten him out,' they employ a prostitute ('María Magdalena' Lengüinsky), who ends up discovering that Jesus is really a hermaphrodite, that he is pregnant, and that the father of his unborn child is St. Joseph himself. When Jesus gets an abortion, Lengüinsky sees her chance to profit from the situation: she blackmails the Holy Family by threatening to go public with the truth about Jesus. Putting their own social status first (including Joseph's political career as a candidate to the Mexican presidency), the Holy Family decides to sacrifice Jesus and sells Lengüinsky the copyright to all images of the crucifixion. 'El Derecho de Abortar' is a poignant satirical commentary on the corruption, intolerance, and contradictory morality at work in the catholic-capitalist society of Mexico. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodréguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a chameleon, Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her espectáculos (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and carpa, to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguezs energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: I am going to die with that woman. Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. In this off-off space, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas, Jesusa y Liliana have produced hundreds of shows since the 1980s.

=520  \\$aMonica Lengüinsky (played by Jesusa Rodríguez) flees to Mexico during the Clinton scandal, becomes a TV writer, and produces "El Derecho de Abortar", a show that is a cross between a pastorela (Christmas play) and a telenovela (soap opera). This pastonovela features Virgin Mary and Joseph of Nazareth as two wealthy Mexicans tormented by the ambiguous sexuality of their cross-dressing son, Jesus Christ. In a failed attempt to straighten him out, they employ a prostitute ("María Magdalena" Lengüinsky), who ends up discovering that Jesus is really a hermaphrodite, that he is pregnant, and that the father of his unborn child is St. Joseph himself. When Jesus gets an abortion, Lengüinsky sees her chance to profit from the situation: she blackmails the Holy Family by threatening to go public with the truth about Jesus. Putting their own social status first (including Josephs political career as a candidate to the Mexican presidency), the Holy Family decides to sacrifice Jesus and sells Lengüinsky the copyright to all images of the crucifixion. El Derecho de Abortar is a poignant satirical commentary on the corruption, intolerance, and contradictory morality at work in the catholic-capitalist society of Mexico.

=520  \\$a'Toda invención conlleva una catástrofe (...) como suicidas en busca de coartada, la gente ansía que llegue el fin del mundo' ('Every invention implies a catastrophe [...] like suicides looking for an alibi, people anxiously await the end of the world'): Italian genius Leonardo Da Vinci (performed by Jesusa Rodríguez), 600-year-old thanks to his discovery of the elixir of immortality, wants to put an end to his life. Living in current Mexico City, the artist strains to recover his artistic talent, while fruitlessly trying to regain hope in humanity, lost because of society's gradual 'sinking' ('hundimiento') and widespread decadence produced by so-called 'Progress.' 'How to paint the end of the world?' Leonardo looks for inspiration in Bob Ross' televised painting classes, in the moral support of his assistant/lover Francesco (Liliana Felipe), in 'interactive painting' (creating an 'interactive' Giocconda with an audience member as his model), in the analysis of Mexico's political 'gallery of terror,' and in watching a fellow Leonardo (Di Caprio) in the film 'Titanic' over and over again. Concluding that humanity is self-destructive, that Renaissance utopias can't survive in an age of technocracy, and that every good invention sinks like the Titanic, Da Vinci finds the antidote to immortality and performs 'his masterpiece' -suicide- which he dedicates to former Secretary of Tourism and regent mayor of Mexico City (charged of corruption and embezzlement) Oscar Espinosa Villareal. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodríguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a chameleon, Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her espectáculos (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and carpa, to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguezs energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: I am going to die with that woman. Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. In this off-off space, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas, Jesusa y Liliana have produced hundreds of shows since the 1980s.

Leonardo Da Vinci (played by Jesusa Rodríguez), living in current Mexico City and being 600-year-old (thanks to the elixir of immortality), reads about the creation and evolution of humanity, in an attempt to counteract his loss of hope in front of society's gradual 'sinking' ('hundimiento') and widespread decadence produced by so-called 'Progress.' This is a mock version of the Genesis as forged by multinational companies, a satirical rendering of social commodification, consumerism, and excessive love for technological innovation at the expense of quality of life as evidenced in Mexico City's urban landscape.

=520  \\$aSince 1981, the Split Britches Company (founded by Lois Weaver, Peggy Shaw, and Deb Margolin, www.splitbritches.com) has written and performed in trio, duet, and solo, as well as collaborated and performed with other artists. They describe their work in this way: 'Our work is rooted in popular culture, but positioned against it. It relies on moments rather than plot, relationships rather than story. It depends on the surprise of transformation rather than the logic of psychological narrative. It straddles the line between performance and theater, exploiting theatricality while exposing the pretense. It is about a community of outsiders, queers, eccentrics. It is feminist because it encourages the imaginative potential in everyone and lesbian because it takes the presence of lesbian on stage as a given.' Their vaudevillian satirical gender-bending performances have received numerous awards, including a Jane Chamber award and four Village Voice OBIE awards. Their collection of scripts, 'Split Britches Feminist Performance/Lesbian Practice', edited by Sue Ellen Case, won the 1997 Lambda Literary Award for Drama. This video documents their show 'Menopausal Gentleman', Peggy Shaw's bluesy, pseudo-stream-of-consciousness lounge act about a butch lesbian going through 'the change'. An Obie-winning, tour de force one-woman show about a menopausal body and the fires of its ageless heart, Peggy Shaw's 'Menopausal Gentleman' is a revelation. Shaw riffs on the hormonal effects of menopause complete with hot flashes, cold sweats, humor and tears, penetrating and perpetuating the mystery in an unlikely persona. She is a tough-speaking film-noir soul performed in Shaw's trademark drag patois (a self-conscious and artificially low New Yorkese), or to put it simply: a tough guy in a swell suit!

=520  \\$aFounded in 1965 by Luis Valdez, El Teatro Campesino was initially the cultural wing of the United Farm Workers union in California's central valley. With a pointed political mission, ETC performed their actos in the fields, agitprop improvisations communicated eloquently with the workers, who could neither read nor write, but recognized themselves and their values in the actos. By 1970 ETC had gained an international reputation, with major contributions to Chicano culture in the U.S. and to the development and expansion of the boundaries of theater everywhere. Theirs is a popular theater rooted in the American streets, early California history, Mayan/Aztec mythology and Mexican folklore and spiritualism, all geared toward expression of social, political and cultural perceptions. Bandido! deals with the life and times, and subsequent death of Tiburcio Vasquez, the last of the Mexican California resistance fighters. Written in 1979/1980, 'Bandido!' was first staged by ETC in 1982, as part of a celebration of 19th Century history in San Juan Bautista, where Vasquez himself lived from 1863-1865. The events of the play cover the last desperate robbery by Vasquez and his followers in Tres Pinos, CA and their pursuit by lawmen and their posses across the state all the way to Los Angeles, where the notorious bandit was wounded and captured. His notoriety inspired an impresario to stage the capture of Vasquez in an instant melodrama, which was a big hit in an LA theater, while the bandit was behind bars in the city jail. As a bilingual poet and 'ladies man', Vasquez had all the makings of a matinée idol and despite the unsavory nature of his crimes he was visited by women until the end. Playwright Luis Valdez thought the layering of melodrama upon melodrama was suitable material for a play that questions the 'manifest destiny of the Old West' while mocking the melodramatic excesses of the period.

=520  \\$aTheir collection of scripts, 'Split Britches Feminist Performance/Lesbian Practice', edited by Sue Ellen Case, won the 1997 Lambda Literary Award for Drama. 'Salad of the Bad Café' is a postmodern cabaret written and performed by Lois Weaver and Peggy Shaw of Split Britches and Asian American performance artist Stacy Makishi. Inspired by Carson McCullers' story 'The Ballad of the Sad Café' and the lives of Tennessee Williams and Yukio Mishima, it is a treatise on love in a post-claustrophobic era. The play begins in 1945, in the summer that lay between the war and the postwar period when Japan was weeping, the American South was seething and the word 'gender' was mostly used in grammar class.   
=520  \\$aThe setting is a café where people come to spend a few hours so that the 'deep bitter knowing that their life is not worth much can be laid to rest.' Racial, gender and regional stereotypes come together to tell a story of unrequited love, in an attempt to demystify the Queer, disorient the Orient and demythify the Southern Gothic and the American Grotesque. This is one of the first iterations of the piece, performed as a work-in-progress in London in 1998.

=520  \\$aFOMMA - Fortaleza de la Mujer Maya - is a collective of Mayan women who use theater as a tool for education and community building. They are performers, playwrights, and teachers who tour their work in their communities and internationally, performing plays that focus on women's and indigenous rights, literacy, cultural survival, ecology, health, and education in the Tzeltal and Tzotzil indigenous languages. 'Víctimas del engaño' deals with the issue of domestic migration and the challenges experienced by a man from a small town who, despite the fact that his wife does not follow him, decides to try his luck in the city. The play narrates the hard life of this man in the city, where people are involved in fraud but also where he is helped by strangers. He finally meets a woman and commits to her, denying the existence of his former wife; he finds comfort in his new family and even builds a successful business.

=520  \\$aThe Quichua del Oriente & Shuar Peoples of the Ecuador Amazon present Sacha Huarmi, a performance of traditional Indigenous music and dance. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city. AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto neighborhood serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area. The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICHs Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICHs visual and performing arts department programs. Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badgers Corner.

=520  \\$aIn ‘Looking In/To The Future,’ the New WORLD Theater worked with young people in the Khmer, Vietnamese, Latina/o, and African-American communities surrounding Amherst, Massachusetts to help them define their cultural identities through writing and theatre activities. In this final presentation of a workshop, the characters discuss their hopes for the future and their family’s expectations of themselves. Among different cultural backgrounds, Cambodia is often referenced, and each of the characters discusses what they want to do with their future. They have dreams, as any kid, of being a writer, an engineer, a soccer player, or a scientist; but they are aware their ethnic identities will be part in the process, and that some of them can be struggling with their national identity. By the end of the play, in spite of all their fears, the young performers’ chant say ‘We are going, Heaven knows where we are going ... We will get there, Heaven knows how we will get there, but we know we will.’
=520  \\$aFrom 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a ‘new world’ - one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting demographics. From a geographic ‘outpost’ in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, methods, and production. One of New WORLD Theater’s artistic legacies is Project 2050, an early call to imagine the U.S. demographic shift, with people of the future - youth, in equal collaboration with artists and scholars.

=520  \\$aFranklin Furnace at Pseudo Programs, Inc. marked the first season of Franklin Furnace's collaboration with Pseudo Online Network. Franklin Furnace’s decision to move from a physical space to a virtual one was prompted by the impact of the culture wars on artistic freedom in the United States. Despite the effort to maintain other physical spaces in Downtown New York, Franklin Furnace’s board determined that access to freedom of expression and a broader audience for emerging artists through new media would be the prime focus of the arts organization. The virtual turn for Franklin Furnace was a radical move that marked the organization’s shift from exhibiting avant-garde work in physical spaces to online realms. Through this gesture, Franklin Furnace investigated the democratic landscape of the Internet as a censorship free space to present political art. Featured presenters in this video recording of the live netcast on The Performance Channel (www.channelp.com) via Pseudo Programs, Inc. include Halona Hilbertz, Bingo Gazingo, Patricia Hoffbauer, Jon Keith, Jason E. Bowman, Kali Lela Colton, Nora York, Anna Mosby Coleman, Lenora Champagne, and Alvin Eng with Yoav Gal.
=520  \\$aFranklin Furnace was founded in 1976 by artist Martha Wilson to champion ephemeral forms neglected by mainstream arts institutions. Franklin Furnace’s mission is to present, preserve, interpret, proselytize and advocate on behalf of avant-garde art, especially forms that may be vulnerable due to institutional neglect, their ephemeral nature, or politically unpopular content. The organization is dedicated to serving artists by providing both physical and virtual venues for the presentation of time-based visual art, including but not limited to artists’ books, installation art, performance art, and unforeseen contemporary avant-garde art forms; and to undertake other activities related to these purposes. Franklin Furnace is committed to serving emerging artists; to assuming an aggressive pedagogical stance with regard to the value of avant-garde art to life; and to fostering artists’ zeal to broadcast ideas. The organization has developed a place in art history for artists’ books, temporary installation art, and performance art. www.franklinfurnace.org

'Creación colectiva' (collective creation), political theater, feminism, and current Colombian sociopolitical and cultural issues are some of the topics covered by Ariza. The artist talks about her role in the creation and trajectory of La Candelaria as well as the joint effort of this ensemble and the Teatro Experimental de Cali (TEC) to create the Corporación Colombiana de Teatro as a mechanism to facilitate a theoretical and practical forum for the discussion, organization, and support of Colombian theater. Furthermore, Patricia comments on her activist and artistic work with marginalized sectors of the Colombian population (women, indigenous people, immigrants, prisoners, etc.), developing interdisciplinary artistic projects designed to empower these communities, exploring the possibilities of collective creation in order to elicit social change. Ariza also discusses the cultural ties and political affinities between Latin American and Latino theaters in the light of shared hemispheric issues like drug traffic, guerrilla warfare, political corruption, immigration, and globalization.

In this interview, Bolaños talks about her life in theater, her participation as a member of the Teatro Experimental de Cali (TEC), and her foundation of La Máscara in 1972 as an ensemble committed to the exploration and denunciation of women's issues in Colombia. Under the rubric of 'the personal is political', La Máscara aspires to be a tool for historical change through social engagement; in this line, Bolaños and her ensemble work with marginalized populations (women, youth), give workshops, teach, and collectively create plays addressing issues of sexuality, domestic violence, homophobia, machismo, political violence, etc. Collaboration is a key strategy throughout their artistic trajectory, having worked with other renowned women in Colombian theater (such as Patricia Ariza and Jacqueline Vidal) and with the international network of women in contemporary theater and performance The Magdalena Project, among others. Furthermore, Bolaños comments on the aesthetic and political points of contact between Colombian and Chicano theaters, and talks about several plays in La Máscara's repertoire.

A prolific playwright and theater director, Buenaventura discusses his most influential contribution to Latin American experimental theater, 'creación colectiva' ('collective creation'); he also comments on the trajectory of the TEC, one of the most important Latin American theater groups, founded by Enrique in 1954. In a dialogue with interviewer Martinez and Colombian actor Lisímaco Núñez, Buenaventura poses a commentary on the interplay between art and politics, the nuances and differences between notions of 'popular' vs. 'populist' theater, and the role and limits of art criticism; taking into account the works by Luis Valdez and El Teatro Campesino, the artist also discusses the aesthetic and political points of contact between Chicano and Colombian theater.

=520  \\$aOne of TEC's plays devoted to historical reconstruction as a work of fiction. The action is located in Haiti right after the French Revolution. Letizia, Napoleon's mother, tells the audience the marvelous deeds of her beloved son and the love conquests of her most beautiful daughter, Paulina. Josephine, Napoleon's wife, comes to Haiti from her exile in Martinica and introduces the political issues of Caribbean islands. Then Napoleon himself takes over: the play follows Bonaparte in the construction of a new empire of his - a fictional 'island of all saints'. Teatro Experimental de Cali (TEC) is a collective of playwrights, actors, dancers, musicians, stage designers and students committed to the exploration and creation of new languages for Latin American theater. Founded in Colombia in 1955 by Enrique Buenaventura and a group of students at the Instituto Departamental de Bellas Artes, TEC has had a long and fruitful trajectory; their artistic and theoretical work has revolutionized the way that theater is conceived and practiced in Latin America. A key contribution to the field is their method of 'creación colectiva' ('collective creation'), in which all the participants of the play - including the audience - become involved with the dramatic text and its staging. In spite of this stress on collective work, TEC had in Enrique Buenaventura its main poet and playwright, who developed most of TEC's texts and directed the majority of their plays. While TEC's works address various historical and social issues, artistic quality is not sacrificed for the sake of political radicalism. TEC has thus created a theater that is politically and culturally engaged, poetic and innovative without losing its popular appeal.

A former member of the Grupo de Teatro La Candelaria (Bogota, Colombia, directed by Santiago García), Camargo founded her theater ensemble in 1982; originally based in Bogota, the Teatro Itinerante del Sol later moved to the rural village of Villa de Leyva in search of a connection with nature and the development of a creative space for their work. In this interview, Beatriz discusses her artistic trajectory; in terms of the Teatro Itinerante del Sol, Camargo talks about the centrality of myths, dreams, rituals, and masks in their theater work. Defined by the artist as 'biodrama', her theater pieces are conceived as explorations on myth and collective memory. Camargo also comments on how her theater projects, through the interplay between the mythical and the historical, address political issues of women and of indigenous peoples in Colombia.

=520  \\$aFranklin Furnace was founded in 1976 by artist Martha Wilson to champion ephemeral forms neglected by mainstream arts institutions. Franklin Furnace’s mission is to present, preserve, interpret, proselytize and advocate on behalf of avant-garde art, especially forms that may be vulnerable due to institutional neglect, their ephemeral nature, or politically unpopular content. The organization is dedicated to serving artists by providing both physical and virtual venues for the presentation of time-based visual art, including but not limited to artists’ books, installation art, performance art, and unforeseen contemporary avant-garde art forms; and to undertake other activities related to these purposes. Franklin Furnace is committed to serving emerging artists; to assuming an aggressive pedagogical stance with regard to the value of avant-garde art to life; and to fostering artists’ zeal to broadcast ideas. The organization has developed a place in art history for artists’ books, temporary installation art, and performance art. www.franklinfurnace.org
=520  \\$aIn Fountain, Patty Chang stares into a mirror while drinking water from her reflection. To create the visual imagery depicted in the frame, Chang placed a video camera on a 45-degree angle while filming the live performance in her studio. Positioning the camera at this angle changes the plane of the video and also reshapes how viewers see the footage of the performance. Viewers are not aware of this stylistic approach when watching the footage, but instead see a re-purposed view of the live performance that has been displayed vertically in the video. The approaches that Chang takes in Fountain are political in their form as well as content, addressing standards of beauty, representations of Asian women, and the problematics of the male gaze. Fountain was intended to be part of Franklin Furnace’s 'History of the Future' (1999) netcast on Pseudo Programs, Inc.’s The Performance Channel (www.channelp.com); however, the corporation went bankrupt during the height of the culture wars leaving the performance footage dormant until published in full length by HIDVL in 2015.
=520  \\$aPatty Chang’s performative works deal with themes of gender, language, and empathy. Working predominantly in video, Chang uses the medium to document her performances, often utilizing the camera’s potential to misrepresent. Her works often challenge viewers’ perceptions of what they see, frequently creating visual sleights of hand that highlight fantastical representations of 'Asia.' Chang’s work has been exhibited nationwide and internationally at the Guggenheim Museum in New York; the New Museum in New York; the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles; the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago; the Hamburg Kunstverein in Hamburg, Germany; and the Moderna Museet in Stockholm, Sweden. She was nominated for the Hugo Boss Prize in 2008, named the Guna S. Mundheim Fellow of Visual Arts at the American Academy in Berlin in 2009, and a recipient of the Guggenheim Fellowship in 2014. www.pattychang.com

=520  \\$aCoatlicue Theater Company produced a three-minute video demonstrating their storytelling/playwriting/theater workshops. Included in the footage are clips from a workshop held in Chiapas, Mexico. The companys workshops are divided into three parts. The first part is aimed at getting participants to open up to one another to begin to work collectively. Its devoted to exercising the body through sounds and movement to stimulate the imagination and awaken the body, mind, and spirit. The second part is designed to teach storytelling and involves exercises that develop trust, listening, and communication skills. Here the Colorado sisters demonstrate the different ways to tell a story, how to work together to tell a story, and listening to others tell a story. Participants are then taught how to incorporate their earlier exercises into the storytelling process and work on developing a theater piece. Elvira and Hortencia Colorado, Chichimec Otomi storytellers, playwrights, performers and community activists are founding members of Coatlicue Theatre Company (www.coatlicue.com). They are also members of Danza Mexica Cetiliztli, New York Zapatistas and the American Indian Community House. The company's plays address social, political, cultural and identity issues that impact their lives and their community. Their work is based on stories they weave together which educate as well as entertain, while reaffirming their survival as urban Native American women. They have conducted storytelling/ theater workshops. They are recipients of the Ingrid Washinawatok Community Activism Award. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city. AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto neighborhood serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area. The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICHs Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICHs visual and performing arts department programs. Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badgers Corner.

=520  \\$aSusana Cook (www.susanacook.com) is a New York-based Argentinean theater and performance artist. Mainly directed to queer and Latino communities in New York City, Cook's work also encompasses a heated response to broader State policies that oppress communities defined in the intersection of race, gender, and class. In her shows, Cook parodies discourses of power, drawing attention to the close ties between the state, religious and political conservatism, and the military. Cook's plays usually feature all-women casts that defy the normative performance of gender, race, and sexuality. 'Hot Tamale' is a Latina fiesta about the Latina stereotype. 1999 was Latin pop singer Ricky Martin's year with his hit song 'La fiesta.' Latinos became the new market. They were considered hot, great lovers, great dancers, and big consumers. 'Hot Tamale' is a show about sex and hot tamales.

=520  \\$aThe world premiere of Dzul Dance Companys, The Fifth Sun, commissioned by the American Indian Community House (AICH). The Fifth Sun combines traditional Native dance and music with contemporary dance movements. Michael Taylor (Delaware), director of the Michael Taylor Dance Co. and Louis Mofsie (Hopi/ Winnebago), director of the Thunderbird American Dancers collaborated together to choreograph the first dance piece in this video. Dzul Dance Companys is directed by Javier D'zul, a native of Mexico. Dzul fuses ritual and modern dance with aerial arts as a means to communicate indigenous pre-Hispanic cultures. By transforming bodies into earth bound and airborne forces of nature Dzul breaks physical, cultural and political boundaries. This daring and unique company bridges the gap between the ancient and the contemporary in order to illuminate the vast array of drama and beauty inherent to the universal human condition. Michael Taylor is a member of the Thunderbird American Indian Dancers. Louis Mofsie is chairperson on the Board of Directors at the American Indian Community House in New York City and Director of the Thunderbird American Dancers, an organization that raises scholarship funds for Native students. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city. AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto neighborhood serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area. The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICHs Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICHs visual and performing arts department programs. Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badgers Corner. Indian Summer is an annual event at AICH and an occasion for artists to present their latest works to the community and the general public. All performers, whether new to the field or veteran practitioners, are encouraged to present their work.

=520  \\$aInterview with renowned Spanish-born Colombian actor Helios Fernández, conducted by Chicano theater scholar Alma Martinez. In this interview, Fernández talks about his experiences as an actor for theater and TV. A former member of Colombian theater ensemble Teatro Experimental de Cali (TEC) for 25 years, Helios discusses the trajectory of the group, the evolution of its dramaturgy, the development of the technique of 'creación colectiva' (collective creation), and the role of TEC's director Enrique Buenaventura in the realm of Latin American theater theory and practice. Among the many influences that have shaped the artistic endeavors of TEC, Fernández points to the importance of Brechtian theories, as well as the strong cross-pollination between their work and that of Chicano theater, primordially the works by Luis Valdez and El Teatro Campesino. The actor then poses an assessment on the scope and limits of political theater, and contrasts it historically, thematically, and administratively to commercial theater in Colombia. In addition to discussing his experiences as an actor in theater, Helios shares his thoughts on Colombian television and its particular acting conditions and techniques.

=520  \\$aThree-session interview with Santiago García, theater director, theorist, playwright, and founder of renowned Colombian theater ensemble Teatro La Candelaria (www.teatrolacandelaria.org.co), conducted by Chicano theater scholar Alma Martinez. In this extensive interview, García discusses key topics germane to his artistic work, narrating his first experiences in theater, the artistic trajectory of La Candelaria (founded in 1966, and still one of the most important theater groups in Latin America), and his personal take on popular theater, collective creation, the influence of Brechtian theories in his artistic work, the role of the director in collaborative artistic collectives, and the state of the scenic arts in Colombia in the context of economic and political crisis. Santiago also comments on the influences and points of contact between Latin American and Latino theaters based on his personal experiences traveling and working with different theater groups, including the Chicano theater ensemble El Teatro Campesino; under the rubric of the 'popular', García analyzes the artistic affinities and ideological choices present in collective creation across the Americas. Finally, the artist shares his thoughts on La Candelaria's rendition of 'El Quijote', based on García's personal adaptation of this literary masterpiece. A carnivalesque mixture of cultures and traditions, this play highlights shared traits between the Spanish novel and Colombian culture, while performing a commentary on illusions, fantasy and utopia, elements that the author finds absent in present-day Colombia.

=520  \\$aDocumentation of a backstage interview with performance artists Guillermo Gómez-Peña and Roberto Sifuentes by filmmaker Ed Morales, along with footage of pre-performance preparations and excerpts of the actual performance at the Magic Theater in San Francisco, CA. Described as a 'high-tech Aztec Spanglish lounge operetta', this performance works through and with Chicano stereotypes -featuring the Cyber Vato, the Mexterminator, the Transvestite Mariachi and other Pocha Nostra 'cultural specimens'- in order to address and examine border-crossing issues of race, gender, language, religion, politics, commodification and multiculturalism. La Pocha Nostra (www.pochanostra.com) is an ever-morphing trans-disciplinary arts organization, founded in 1993 by Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Roberto Sifuentes, and Nola Mariano in California. The objective was to formally conceptualize Gómez-Peña's collaborations with other performance artists. It provides a base (and forum) for a loose network of rebel artists from various disciplines, generations and ethnic backgrounds, whose common denominator is the desire to cross and erase dangerous borders between art and politics, practice and theory, artist and spectator. As of June 2006, members include performance artists Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Violeta Luna, Michelle Ceballos, and Roberto Sifuentes; curators Gabriela Salgado and Orlando Britto; and over thirty associates worldwide in countries such as Mexico, Spain, the UK, and Australia. Projects range from performance solos and duets to large-scale performance installations including video, photography, audio, and cyber-art. La Pocha collaborates across national borders, race, gender and generations. Their collaborative model functions both as an act of citizen diplomacy and as a means to create ephemeral communities of like-minded rebels. The basic premise of these collaborations is founded on an ideal: If we learn to cross borders on stage, we may learn how to do so in larger social spheres. La Pocha strives to eradicate myths of purity and dissolve borders surrounding culture, ethnicity, gender, language, and métier. These are radical acts.

=520  \\$aTeresa Hernández is a Puerto Rican stage artist. Since 1987 she has written, directed and performed contemporary theater and dance, both in Puerto Rico's commercial and experimental art scenes. Teresa's creative projects are characterized by a consistent eschewing of traditional artistic categories. Theater, dance, performance, dramatic text, movement, costumes, video and everyday objects are juxtaposed and confronted, placed in a liminal space where notions of precariousness are explored and celebrated. "La nostalgia del quinqué...una huida" explores and exposes the anxieties of everyday life in Puerto Rican society, transversally investigating issues of gender, class and race. A series of tableaux vivants of the "Puerto Rican Family" shows a stereotypical version of the folkloric peasant family ("jíbaros") from the "literatura costumbrista" (dealing with the transit form a rural society to an industrial, urban one) in a tragicomic clash of anachronisms, self-inflicted bigotry and partisan politics, negotiated in a desperate juggle of contrasting realities, evasion, euphemisms and denial that evidence the identity crisis of Puerto Rican society. These tableaux perform an antiphonal relationship to three "sister" characters through which Hernández exposes her take on Puerto Rican identity crisis and colonialism: Lic. Perdóname (a district representative), Pragma la continental (with her self-help lecture inviting Puerto Ricans "to climb and to progress") and Perpetua (a sensual "Pan-Latin" singer), who, with the help of their assistant Lamento, unveil the political, socio-historic and ethno-cultural complexities of "the Puerto Rican condition".

=520  \\$aShort film by Puerto Rican stage artist Teresa Hernández and her Producciones Teresa, no inc., in collaboration with director of photography Daniel Cotté and editor Vicente Juarbe. Puerto Rico, a Caribbean island struggling with an authentic identity crisis, torn in the in-between zone of an oblique colonialism, delusions of cosmopolitan aspirations sold by tourism advertisements, a half-baked bilingualism, and self-inflicted bigotry, produces a foreign movie which is at the same time a Puerto Rican film. Spoken in a fictional pidgin, and subtitled in Spanish, it portrays a tragicomic Grand Reunion of individuals fixed on evading and denying the Puerto Rican condition through the impersonation of alternative citizenships and absurd allegiances. The video art piece show subjects living in anachronism and escapism, surrounding themselves in an artificial aura of the exotic that directly contrasts with the everyday life in the islands metropolitan area. The short film, shown as a stand-alone piece in film festivals locally and abroad, is also a building block of sorts, combined and recombined by Hernández in her multimedia spectacles in order to explore and unveil the complex layers of negotiation and denial at play in issues of identity politics of our postmodern societies.

In this interview, Hernández narrates her experiences as a theater actress with renowned theater ensembles such as La Candelaria, Teatro Experimental de Cali (TEC), Teatro Popular de Bogotá (TPB), and the Teatro Nacional, as well as her trajectory as an actress for TV and film. In the light of the political climate and economic crisis of late 20th-century Colombia, the artist poses a commentary on how cultural policies are played out in Colombian theater, TV, and cinema industries. Comparing and contrasting the different aspects and techniques of acting in these realms, Vicky discusses the importance of the actor's training and education, stressing it as an urgent need to strengthen the artistic métier in her country.

=520  \\$aDanny Hoch (www.dannyhoch.com) is an actor, playwright and director whose plays 'Pot Melting', 'Some People', and 'Jails, Hospitals & Hip-Hop' have garnered many awards including 2 OBIES, a NEA Solo Theatre Fellowship, Sundance Writers Fellowship, CalArts/Alpert Award In Theatre and a Tennessee Williams Fellowship. He is a Senior Fellow at the New School's Vera List Center For Art & Politics and his writings on hip-hop, race and class have appeared in 'The Village Voice' and 'New York Times', among others; his book 'Jails, Hospitals & Hip-Hop' is in its second printing by Villard Books/Random House. Mr. Hoch also founded the 'Hip-Hop Theater Festival' in 2000 which has since presented over 75 hip-hop generation plays from all over the world. A third-generation New Yorker who grew up during the birth of hip-hop culture in a multiracial outer-borough neighborhood, Danny brings together his inner monologues, layered composites of stories and voices form his personal experiences, stories of his community and his generation, placing traditionally peripheral characters center stage. Characters like prison convicts Bronx and Andy; correction officer with anger management problems Sam; Victor, a young man on permanent steel crutches because of police brutality; young Cuban student Peter; and successful rapper Emcee Enuff, all evidence this outstanding contemporary work, reunited under the title 'Jails, Hospitals & Hip-Hop', here performed at the Rikers Island prison complex in New York City. Hoch shares the stage with guest performer Flaco Navaja, poet, singer, actor, comedian and activist from the Bronx, host of 'All That! Hip Hop Poetry & Jazz', the legendary open mic. An urban griot for the communities of urban North America, Hoch combines hip-hop culture's worldview and expressive strategies of resistance along with storytelling riffs, actively exploring language in order to move the audience from passive entertainment to active engagement.

=518  \\$aPerformed at the New Conservatory Theatre, San Francisco, CA, USA, in September 1999.
=520  \\$aHolly Hughes investigates the politics of art and democracy in Preaching to the Perverted. She discusses her recent appearance before the U.S.Supreme Court in the case NEA v. Finley (1998). Hughes, along with Karen Finley, John Fleck, and Tim Miller, were awarded grants by the National Endowment for the Arts that were later revoked for obscenity. The group of artists, which became known as the NEA Four, filed a case against the National Endowment for the Arts asserting First Amendment and statutory claims. Hughes reenacts scenes from the U.S. Supreme Court trial that she calls ‘theatrical spectacles,’ while noting the larger context of censorship in the arts in the United States. She de-centers national debates surrounding freedom, citizenship, and democracy from a lesbian feminist point of view and asserts her artistic freedom by creating performances that reflect a radical body politic. Hughes’ testimony, alongside those of Finley, Fleck, and Miller, led the U.S. Supreme Court to rule in favor of the NEA Four’s case against the National Endowment for the Arts. She further elaborates upon the NEA Four trial and the conservative political climate of the nation during the case in the Q&A session following the performance. Preaching to the Perverted was intended to be part of Franklin Furnace’s ‘History of the Future’ (1999) netcast on Pseudo Programs, Inc.’s The Performance Channel (www.channelp.com); however, the corporation went bankrupt during the height of the culture wars leaving the performance footage dormant until published in full length by HIDVL in 2015.
=520  \\$aHolly Hughes is a writer and performer, who began her thespian adventures at the WOW Cafe Theater in the Lower East Side of New York City. Her work deals with questions of identity and sexual desire, drawing recognition including two Village Obie Awards, a Guggenheim Fellowship, funding from Creative Capital, NYSCA, and the NEA, as well as the ire of the religious right during the culture wars. Hughes’s books include Clit Notes: A Sapphic Sampler (1996), O Solo Homo: The New Queer Performance (1998), Animal Acts: Performing Species Today (2014), and Memories of the Revolution: Ten Years of the WOW Cafe (forthcoming). She is a Professor at the University of Michigan where she founded the BFA in Interarts Performance.

=520  \\$aCommissioned by Yerba Buena Center for the Arts (1998-1999 Wattis Artist-in-residence, established by Mr. and Mrs. Paul Wattis with leadership support from Catherine and Ted Topham), this is the third incarnation of Latina Theater Lab’s Last Stop Ranchera. Drawing on personal histories and memories, seven women discover stories of love, betrayal, loss, shattered dreams and, ultimately, pride. The play has three movements: 'Once' – Stories from the past and about ancestors; 'Jump' – Stories about family and growing up, viewed through little girls’ eyes; 'Forte' – Observations that try to explain and to assume who we are today. Latina Theatre Lab was one of the first and only all-Latina collective of writers, performers, and directors in the U.S. Their performance-sketch work dealt with pop culture, immigration, cross-cultural identities, and the complexities of 'being Latina.' It was founded in 1994 by four San Francisco Bay Area actresses: Dena Martinez, Jaime Lujan, Tessa Koning-Martinez and Wilma Bonet. Their purpose was to create theater that would go beyond the ever shrinking and limited range of roles for which Latina actresses were being considered. These roles were scarce, and rarely defied stereotypes. From 1994-1999, Latina Theatre Lab's work played with these cultural and gender stereotypes, exploring the legacies they inherited both as Latinas and as women. They also have collaborated with Culture Clash, the Asian American Theater Company, and the 18 Mighty Mountain Warriors.

This series of eloquent monologues is expressed in three movements. 'Once' is comprised of stories passed from people never known, now long gone. The movement 'Jump' reveals observations of the family, revealed by little girls’ eyes. The third movement, 'Forte,' presents reflections of who we are today.

=520  \\$aLa Peña Cultural Center first hosted Latina Theatre Lab, Culture Clash, and 18 Mighty Mountain Warriors for a Comedy Slam. They reworked their cross-cultural sketch comedy and added different material for the New Langton show. Some women from The Asian American Theater Company had formed a writing group to support and give feed back to each other. Latina Theatre Lab collaborated with them, exploring similarities in dealing with discrimination as well as cultural stereotypes that Latinos and Asians have about each other. Latina Theatre Lab was one of the first and only all-Latina collective of writers, performers, and directors in the U.S. Their performance-sketch work dealt with pop culture, immigration, cross-cultural identities, and the complexities of 'being Latina.' The group was founded in 1994 by four San Francisco Bay Area actresses: Dena Martinez, Jaime Lujan, Tessa Koning-Martinez and Wilma Bonet. Their purpose was to create theater that would go beyond the ever shrinking and limited range of roles for which Latina actresses were being considered.

=520  \\$aInterview with theater director and founder of street theater ensemble Teatro Taller de Colombia, Mario Matallana, conducted by Chicano theater scholar Alma Martinez. In this interview, Matallana talks about the strong experiential, aesthetic and political ties between his theater work and Chicano theater, especially in relation to the work of Luis Valdez and El Teatro Campesino. Issues of Latino and Latin American identity and solidarity are discussed, as well as the limits and possibilities of political theater as a tool for aesthetic exploration and social intervention. Mario also comments on the aesthetic coordinates of street theater, characterizing the work in Teatro Taller as one devoted to the creation of a 'text of images' through choreography of movement; he considers this type of performance to be political, but with a different language, one that broadens the theater audience and addresses current sociopolitical issues in new expressive ways. As a big discipline with different branches and traditions that can contribute and enrich one another, street theater has inspired Teatro Taller (www.teatrotallerdecolombia.com) to create and produce the Festival Internacional de Teatro Callejero al Aire Puro ('Open Air International Street Theater Festival') in Colombia. Matallana comments on the importance of this effort in the context of the trajectory of Teatro Taller; furthermore, he talks about some of the plays in their repertoire ('Génesis', 'Las sombras del olvido'), paying special attention to how their aesthetic as a street performance troupe has developed - influenced by international artistic collaboration - over the years.

=520  \\$aWinnetou's Snake Oil Show from Wigwam City is loosely based on the fictional Apache character Winnetou and his close friend Old Shatterhand, made famous by nineteenth century German author, Karl May. Spiderwoman Theater satirizes the stereotypes perpetuated by authors like May and New Ageism in general, by performing a bona fide Snake Oil Show, spoofing the New Age plastic shaman, phony mysticism, and the wannabe Indians who have come to expect miraculous results from American Indian spirituality. Spiderwoman Theater is the longest continuous running Native female performance group. Comprised of three Kuna/ Rappahannock sisters from Brooklyn, New York, Lisa Mayo, Gloria Miguel, and Muriel Miguel, the group has travel all over the world giving performance, lectures, and workshops. Named after the weaver in the Hopi creation story the sisters storyweave their message in a variety of formats including poetry, dance, theater, and song. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city. AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto neighborhood serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area. The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICHs Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICHs visual and performing arts department programs. Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badgers Corner. Indian Summer is an annual event at AICH and an occasion for artists to present their latest works to the community and the general public. All performers, whether new to the field or veteran practitioners, are encouraged to present their work.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of Circus Amok's show 'Quality of Life II', performed in Tompkins Square Park in New York City in 1999. A joyful extravaganza of acrobatic artistry, satiric skill, and good old-fashioned circus fun, this piece bring together utopic and dystopic aspects of living in NYC at the turn of the millennium. Police brutality, privatization, and excessive construction of corporate and commercial buildings in former residential areas (including the demolition of community gardens) are some aspects of an ongoing political process of restricting the pubic sphere, to which the troupe counteracts through the proposal and support of education, advocating for freedom and creativity, community building, and the public denunciation of abuse and injustice. Circus Amok (www.circusamok.org) is a New York City based circus-theater company whose mission is to provide free public art addressing contemporary issues of social justice to the people of New York City. Directed and founded by Jennifer Miller, the group has been together since 1989 bringing its funny, queer, caustic and sexy, political one-ring spectacles to diverse neighborhoods throughout the city. Over the years the traditional circus skills - tight rope walking, juggling, acrobatics, stilt walking, clowning - have been combined with experimental dance, lifesize puppetry, music old and new, and gender-bending performance art and improvisational techniques, creating new meanings for circus while continuing to entertain the crowds of all ages throughout the city streets, gardens, parks, and playgrounds, inviting the audience to join them in envisioning a more empowered life of community interaction while enjoying a queer celebratory spectacle.

=520  \\$a'Historia de una utopía' documents the first 16 years of theater work by Argentinean community theater ensemble Grupo de Teatro Catalinas Sur. Told in the words of the group itself (with an array testimonies by diverse group members), and illustrated with extensive video and photo documentation, this video maps out the origins and philosophy of the Catalinas Sur, while showcasing the variety of outdoor and indoor theater projects they have embarked on since 1983 - from 'Las Comediantes,' performed in Plaza Malvinas in 1983, to 'El Fulgor Argentino,' here shown at the group's own Galpón in 1999. The idea of Grupo de Teatro Catalinas Sur (www.catalinasur.com.ar) came to life during a neighborhood barbeque held by a school's parents association in 1983. It was during the time of Argentina's military dictatorship, which stifled popular expression, and the theater group used its community service as a form of resistance that strengthened feelings of solidarity and mutual binding. The group remains rooted in its Buenos Aires neighborhood, even as its membership and fame has grown, performing in a converted warehouse. Catalinas Sur members are acknowledged followers of the traditional artistic forms performed in the quarter which has been the birthplace of the popular arts: puppeteers, musicians, actors, artists originating from the old continent or from Latin America and who mingled their art, like a crucible, with the neighborhood. Firm believers that society can be changed by teamwork and a sense of community, Catalinas Sur has created more than 20 plays and, sweeping aside all false generation gaps, has now over 300 actors. In their own words, 'with the advent of this globalized and inhumane millennium, we are attempting, through the theater, to remember the value of our individual and collective histories, and revive the memory that believed and believes in a better world.'

=518  \\$aRecorded in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 1999.
=520  \\$aBased in Porto Alegre, The Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz was born in 1978 out of a desire for a radical renovation of the language of theatre. During the several years of their existence, they have created a personal aesthetics founded upon the authorial work of the actor, both on the stage and on the streets. Their venue, the Terreira da Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, works as a community theatre school, offering several free workshops open to the public. Their tribal organization is based on the principle of collective work, both in the creative process and in the maintenance of the space. For Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, theater is an instrument for both revealing and analyzing reality, and it's function is social: to contribute to the collective knowledge and to the improvement of the quality of life of the people. In a world marked by exclusion, marginalization, homogenization, by dehumanizing and barbaric efforts, they see it as their moral imperative to denounce injustice, sold opinions, authoritarianism, mediocrity and the erasing of memory. Ói Nóis sees theatre as an art of resistance, in the service of arts and politics, an art that does not fit the market patterns for ethics and aesthetics. Instead, they see theater as a way of life and as a vehicle for ideas: a theater that does not comment on life, but that takes part in it.
=520  \\$aIn Hamletmachine, Heiner Müller finds the site for the revolutionary construction of a new theater. His texts are formed of fragments, shattered scenes, and derisory monologues, stimuli for the creative invention of a performed reality, the only reality capable of transgressively translating the complexity of contemporary existence. In one of the final scenes in Ói Nóis' adaptation, the dead figure of Stalin appears in the TV monitors, while three naked actresses parade wearing giant heads of Marx, Lenin and Mao. The characters and scenes are pulverized and multifaceted, allowing for distinct and contradictory readings, which provide for countless concrete political interpretations and symbolic references.

=520  \\$aInterview with Colombian actor and member of the theater ensemble Teatro Experimental de Cali (TEC) Lisímaco Núñez, conducted by Chicano theater scholar Alma Martinez. In this interview, Núñez talks about his artistic trajectory and his experiences working as a member of TEC. The actor discusses the aesthetic idiosyncrasies of the group, their acting techniques, the choices of dramatic texts, the exploration of elements seemingly external to the theater realm (martial arts, etc.), and some of the theoretical and artistic influences shaping the work of the group. Lisímaco also talks about the interplay between arts and politics, discussing theater as a possible alternative space for social expression. Collective creation is discussed, as well as the points of contact and divergence between the TEC and other renowned Colombian theater groups (like La Candelaria, directed by Santiago García). The artist extends his analysis of the connections between theater groups to the influences and relationships between Colombian, Latin American and Chicano theaters, posing a reflection on the complexities of culture inserted in a broader sociopolitical and artistic hemispheric context.

=520  \\$aAn adaptation of "Réquiem por Yarini", a play written in the '60s by Cuban playwright Carlos Felipe, "La Vida en Rosa" is the story of Alejandro Yarini, a pimp and politician stabbed to death in the early 1900s. A "musical tragedy", the piece revolves around a love triangle in an environment ruled by foreign capital, prostitution and tourism, a tropical masquerade in cabaret style where song and dance are mask sadness, innocence, tragedy. The play is an exploration of passion, questioning heritage and myth, a critical look at the past and the manifold structures of time. Teatro Buendía, formed in 1986 by graduates from the Higher Institute of Arts, Havana, and directed by Flora Lauten, is Cuba's most celebrated theater company. Since its foundation, they have developed two parallel lines of work: the production of theater spectacles, and a permanent research center investigating Latin American and Caribbean cultural traditions, the expressive possibilities of the actor, and the renewal of scenic languages. The study of the possible relations between music, dance, and interpretation, as well as the formulation of new forms of scenic writing and dramaturgy of the spectacle, has consolidated Teatro Buendía's international prestige as a company that has presented their repertoire in the most demanding festivals and venues of Latin America, Europe, North America, Asia, Africa and Australia, all to critical acclaim. They also tour internationally giving workshops, seminars and conferences on their cultural investigations and creative methods.

=518  \\$aPerformed at Teatro Bar El Hábito, Mexico City, in Nov. 1999.
=508  \\$aJesusa Rodríguez, writer, director, producer ; Liliana Felipe, producer, music.
=511  1\$aJesusa Rodríguez, Isela Vega, Yoma Vela, Roberto Cabral, Liliana Felipe (musician).
=520  \\$aIn this 'political-poetical-philosophical-musical' cabaret performance, Jesusa Rodríguez and Liliana Felipe take on Mexico's electoral climate in order to pose a comment on ethics, politics, Mexican folklore and pop culture. Rodríguez populates the scenario of the 'palenque' ('cockpit', a place for popular gambling games like cockfighting) with chameleonic characters Chona Schopenhauer ('the only ranchera philosopher'), Pita Amor (an old-fashioned, affected performer of poetry) and Don Andrés Soler (a very macho, politically conservative old man), among others, through which the artist criticizes the corruption and violence associated with Mexico's political climate. In a 'phenomenology of fortuitous becoming', the universe is portrayed as 'a palenque where anything could happen', and Mexican electoral processes as a 'gamble'. 
=520  \\$aIn this vein, and interspersed with parodic renditions of traditional folk songs by Rodríguez and 'sexy ranchera' Isela Vega (a famous Mexican vedette), the audience is invited to play a satirical Mexican 'lotería' (with cards like 'The Wetback', 'The Zapatista', 'The First Lady', and 'The ATM' substituting the traditional icons of this popular game) and to gamble, control, and judge an electoral 'cockfight' where puppets of political candidates race to be the first to reach the finishing line of Mexico's presidency. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodríguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a 'chameleon,' Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones.   
=520  \\$aHer 'espectáculos' (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and 'carpa,' to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodríguez's energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics.   
=520  \\$aLiliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: 'I am going to die with that woman.' Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. In this off-off space, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas, Jesusa y Liliana have produced hundreds of shows since the 1980s.

=520  \\$aInterview with Jesusa Rodríguez, conducted by Diana Taylor, founding director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. In this interview, Jesusa Rodríguez discusses the possibility of developing a non-Western, Mesoamerican acting technique, based in a pre-Hispanic conception of the human being, which understands the body in a conjunction of mind and spirit. Jesusa Rodríguez follows Alfredo Federico López Austin’s research on the Aztec worldview and on Mesoamerican religion, and explains how she concentrates her strength in bodily channeling the persons she characterizes in her shows. In the second part of this interview, she channels La Malinche, the interpreter and lover of Hernán Cortés in Mexico’s Conquest, to tell her true story. Through this example, and in a dialogue with contemporary indigenous communities’ struggles, Jesusa Rodríguez proposes alternative ways of knowledge, and alternative art and performance techniques, based on indigenous worldviews.
=520  \\$aJesusa Rodríguez is Mexico’s most influential cabaret and political performance artist, and recipient of an Obie Award. Often referred to as a chameleon, Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her work challenges traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass; from Greek tragedy to cabaret; from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera; from revue, sketch and carpa, to performative acts within political projects. She ran the famous El Hábito in Mexico City with her partner, Liliana Felipe, where they staged hundreds of shows over the course of fifteen years. Most recently, she heads up the Resistencia Creativa movement in Mexico, whose key strategy is using ‘massive cabaret’ as a tool for political action.

=520  \\$aFor this East Coast Artists production, Schechner largely used the 1603 First Quarto and character names derived from earlier source texts. Schechner proposes a collision of 21st century American popular culture, Elizabethan poetry, and a medieval Danish story. Using contemporary U.S. idiomatic expressions, ballroom dancing, and pop icons such as Marilyn Monroe (Gertred) and Shirley Temple (Ofelia), 'Hamlet' embodies a cyclone of tragedy enacted within the postmodernity of the 21st century. As Schechner writes in his program note, Monroe and others steal the words of Shakespeare's characters and haunt the play from the future - just as Gertrude, an ancient woman, haunts it from the past. Claudius is both a Viking pirate and a contemporary globalizing marauder, blustering and handsome. Polonius is a talking head, a TV pundit full of shopworn sagacity. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are literally rats, their tails trailing behind them as they do tap routines. 
=520  \\$aClaudius hums Broadway tunes. The 'Get thee to a nunnery' scene transforms from a ballroom dance number into a violent encounter. Polonius is in an incestuous relationship with Ofelia who is much too old to wear the clothes she does. When her father is murdered, Ofelia cracks up. Hamlet is angry, lost, an outsider in his own home, ironic, crazy, and determined in his indeterminacy. Richard Schechner is a theater director, performance theorist and university professor known for being one of the founders of the academic discipline of Performance Studies at Tisch School of the Arts, New York University. Schechner combines his work in anthropology with innovative approaches to performance of all kinds including ritual, drama, environmental theater, political rallies, dance, music, etc. in order to consider how performance can be understood not just as an object of study, but also as an active intellectual-artistic practice.   
=520  \\$aHe is the editor of 'TDR: The Journal of Performance Studies.' His books include 'Environmental Theater,' 'The Future of Ritual,' 'Performance Theory,' 'Between Theater and Anthropology' and 'Performance Studies: An Introduction.' As of 2007, his books have been translated into 14 languages.

=520  \\$aFounded in 1965 by Luis Valdez, El Teatro Campesino was initially the cultural wing of the United Farm Workers union in California's central valley. With a pointed political mission, ETC performed their actos in the fields, agitprop improvisations communicated eloquently with the workers, who could neither read nor write, but recognized themselves and their values in the actos. By 1970 ETC had gained an international reputation, with major contributions to Chicano culture in the U.S. and to the development and expansion of the boundaries of theater everywhere. Theirs is a popular theater rooted in the American streets, early California history, Mayan/Aztec mythology and Mexican folklore and spiritualism, all geared toward expression of social, political and cultural perceptions. The Shrunken Head of Pancho Villa (1964) is the first full-length play written by Luis Valdez. A raucous absurdist comedy about Mexican-Americans on the verge of the Chicano Civil Rights movement of the 1960s, the play sends up racist stereotypes still deeply entrenched in the 1950s, including the wino father, long suffering mother, the juvenile delinquent son, the pregnant/unwed daughter, the indigent older brother, the shell-shocked son home from the war, and the whole family on welfare. To complete his assault on prejudicial images, Valdez throws in ubiquitous head lice and giant cucarachas (cockroaches). But the capper is the character of the totally dependent oldest son, Belarmino (Belo), whose physical handicap is extreme: he has no body. Belo is a bodiless head, who cannot even talk, except to sing La Cucaracha, with a vengeance. Crawling with lice, drooling and grunting, Belos gargantuan appetite keeps his family broke, until brother Mingo comes home from the army determined to change things. Thats when the head begins to talk.

In this interview, Vargas comments on his life in theater, his collaboration with theater director Mario Matallana, and their founding of Teatro Taller (www.teatrotallerdecolombia.com) in Bogota, Colombia. An ensemble rooted in popular theater, street theater, and circus, the project of Teatro Taller has been nourished by Vargas' and Matallana's many travels across the world, their participation in international theater festivals, and their collaboration with theater ensembles in Europe, Latin America and the US; their direct contact with Chicano theater has been particularly influential in Teatro Taller's consolidation of its own theatrical language. Committed to the exploration and dissemination of street theater in Colombia and abroad, Teatro Taller has developed international projects of artistic collaboration, such as the Escuela Internacional de Teatro Callejero y Circo ('International Street Theater and Circus School') and the Festival Internacional de Teatro Callejero al Aire Puro ('Open Air International Street Theater Festival').

=520  \\$aInterview with theater practitioner Jacqueline Vidal, director of renowned theater ensemble Teatro Experimental de Cali (TEC), conducted by Chicano theater scholar Alma Martinez. In this interview, Jaqueline talks about her passage from her native France to Colombia with her husband (TEC's founder Enrique Buenaventura), her life as a theater artist, her collaborative process with Buenaventura, and the influences of her international and Colombian experiences in shaping her unique directing style. Collective creation is discussed, paying special attention to considerations of space, the dialogue between the dramatic text and the actors, and the presence of myths in theater plays; Vidal has always felt passionate for the spatial, non-verbal communication between people and how these elements shape a theater capable of making the everyday shake, rendering the invisible visible, and opening a space for imagination, for the possibility of living in an alternative, organic world in a time where fragmentation permeates social interaction. In conversation with Martinez, the artist discusses the aesthetic and political points of contact between Chicano and Colombian theater. Luis Valdez and El Teatro Campesino's interplay between 'wonderful theater' and 'responsible politics', argues Vidal, has been influential to the joint efforts by prestigious Colombian theater practitioners to bridge their artistic and political practices through collaboration, the organization of festivals, joint seminars, etc. Issues of mestizaje, art, politics and gender are also discussed by Vidal, paying special attention to the role and participation of women in Latin American and Latino theater and their relationship to feminist struggles.

=520  \\$aSince 1981, the Split Britches Company (founded by Lois Weaver, Peggy Shaw, and Deb Margolin, www.splitbritches.com) has written and performed in trio, duet, and solo, as well as collaborated and performed with other artists. They describe their work in this way: 'Our work is rooted in popular culture, but positioned against it. It relies on moments rather than plot, relationships rather than story. It depends on the surprise of transformation rather than the logic of psychological narrative. It straddles the line between performance and theater, exploiting theatricality while exposing the pretense. It is about a community of outsiders, queers, eccentrics. It is feminist because it encourages the imaginative potential in everyone and lesbian because it takes the presence of lesbian on stage as a given.' Their vaudevillian satirical gender-bending performances have received numerous awards, including a Jane Chamber award and four Village Voice OBIE awards. Their collection of scripts, 'Split Britches Feminist Performance/Lesbian Practice', edited by Sue Ellen Case, won the 1997 Lambda Literary Award for Drama. This video documents the one-woman show 'Faith and Dancing'. Written and performed by Lois Weaver, the piece is an autobiographical journey from an early life growing up a strict Southern Baptist in 1950's Virginia to lesbian femme in the 1990's. In Weaver's exploration, faith meets science and sermons meets striptease and she reconciles how a youthful evangelist became an aging exhibitionist.

They are performers, playwrights, and teachers who tour their work in their communities and internationally, performing plays that focus on women's and indigenous rights, literacy, cultural survival, ecology, health, and education in the Tzeltal and Tzotzil indigenous languages. 'Amores en el barranquito' is a tale about a young couple in love and how the way they live their lives (especially the woman's following of her husband's desires without being able to question them) leads them into hardship. As the play develops the situation worsens when the couple's children grow up: their future is jeopardized, for there are too many family members to take care of. The play acts as an invitation to reflect on issues of family planning and how responsible planning could ensure that each family member gets access to food and education.

After they are cheated and mistreated by the people they encounter in the city, they meet a woman who directs them to an institution in which they can participate in different workshops and learn to speak louder and defend themselves.

=520  \\$aIn Secret Identities, the Guerrilla Girls discuss the exclusion of women artists, writers, and performers in art history. Concealed behind gorilla masks, the Guerrilla Girls take on the names of dead women artists - Claude Cahun, Julia de Burgos, Audre Lorde, and Ana Mendieta, among others - as a feminist gesture to counter the erasure of their work by cultural and artistic institutions. Furthermore, the video includes footage of Guerrilla Girls street actions targeting museums and galleries that fail to include women artists in their exhibitions and collections. Several women artists are listed at the end of Secret Identities as a political act to re-inscribe their names into art history, which has otherwise failed to include or recognize such contributions to art practice and discourse.
=520  \\$aThe Guerilla Girls are an anonymous women's collective that take on the names of dead women artists as pseudonyms for interventions. Concealed behind gorilla masks in action, the Guerilla Girls use various tactics to intervene in art, culture, and politics. Through the production of printed materials, publications, and performance actions, the Guerilla Girls expose political matters, convey information, and provoke discussions in public contexts. Notorious for exposing the exclusion of women artists, the Guerilla Girls have staged interventions at the Museum of Modern Art, the Venice Biennale, the Centre Pompidou, among other renowned venues. The Guerilla Girls work is presented from feminist and humorist perspectives. www.guerrillagirls.com

=520  \\$aAugusto Boal is an innovative and influential Brazilian theatrical director, writer, pedagogue and politician. He is considered to be on of the most important creators of political theater since Brecht. Boal is the author of Theater of the Oppressed, Games for Actors and Non-Actors, Rainbow of Desire, Legislative Theater, among others. He was a Member of Parliament for Rio de Janeiro from 1993-1996. Boal is the founder of Theater of the Oppressed, a political theatrical form originally used in radical popular education movements, growing up alongside Paulo Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed. Theater of the Oppressed is a system of games and special techniques that aims at developing, in the oppressed citizens, the language of the theater, in order to help them fight against their oppressions and to transform the society that engenders those oppressions. The word Oppressed is used in the sense of s/he who has lost the right to express his/her wills and needs, and is reduced to the condition of obedient listener of a monologue. It must be used as an instrument of concrete social transformation, a tool of fighting against all forms class oppression, racism, sexism, and all kinds of discrimination. In this workshop and keynote address, celebrated in the context of in the context of the first Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, held at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 2000, Boal talks about the history and coordinates of the Theater of the Oppressed. He also shares with the participants some of the ludic exercises included in Games for Actors and Non-Actors. The workshop ends with a demonstration of Forum Theater, with performances by two groups linked to the Centro de Teatro do Oprimido: Grupo Artimanha (on issues of AIDS and homosexuality) and Grupo Panela de Oppresão (on the forced displacement of disempowered, marginalized communities).

'Sans Gravity' is a performance/action in which Nao introduces her head into a plastic bag filled with water and then tapes it tightly onto her neck. She then sits down upright with the bag on her head. The action creates a real and urgent situation that the artist has to respond to. It ends when Nao, after a minute and twenty seconds, gets free from the water-bag finally breathing like a fish out of water.

=520  \\$aCoatlicue Theater's 'Chicomoztoc-mimixcoa - Cloud Serpents' was first performed as a work in progress in 1996 at the New World Theater in Amherst, MA as part of a summer program titled 'New Works for a New World.' This video was filmed during the American Indian Community House's (AICH) 2000 Indian Summer season and captures the first time the completed work was performed in New York. Elvira and Hortencia Colorado explain the piece as being 'a journey through dreams, stories, time and memory, across mountains and deserts, retracing the footsteps of the ancestors, traveling back to Chicomoztoc (the place of our origin), searching, digging up and gathering stories that have been buried through centuries of shame and denial in our family, but which connect us to our past and identity. Some stories/secrets remain buried, and they are also part of who we are. We honor all those who struggled with their shame and denial. This is an offering to all of our relations'. Elvira and Hortencia Colorado, Chichimec Otomi storytellers, playwrights, performers and community activists are founding members of Coatlicue Theatre Company (www.coatlicue.com). They are also members of Danza Mexica Cetiliztli, New York Zapatistas and the American Indian Community House. The company's plays address social, political, cultural and identity issues that impact their lives and their community. Their work is based on stories they weave together which educate as well as entertain, while reaffirming their survival as urban Native American women. They have conducted storytelling/ theatre workshops. They are recipients of the Ingrid Washinawatok Community Activism Award. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city. AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto 'neighborhood' serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area. The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICH's Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980's, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICH's visual and performing arts department programs. Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badger's Corner. 'Indian Summer' is an annual event at AICH and an occasion for artists to present their latest works to the community and the general public. All performers, whether new to the field or veteran practitioners, are encouraged to present their work.

=520  \\$aSusana Cook (www.susanacook.com) is a New York-based Argentinean theater and performance artist. Mainly directed to queer and Latino communities in New York City, Cook's work also encompasses a heated response to broader State policies that oppress communities defined in the intersection of race, gender, and class. In her shows, Cook parodies discourses of power, drawing attention to the close ties between the state, religious and political conservatism, and the military. Cook's plays usually feature all-women casts that defy the normative performance of gender, race, and sexuality. 'Gross National Product' is a response to the Giuliani administration in New York and the devastating effects that his policies had on the poor. The play deploys the interrelation between poverty, the working class and marginalization.

=520  \\$aThis is a video documentation of ‘Clothes,’ a play by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni, which discusses complex topics such as racism, multi-cultural relationships, economic disparity, and arranged marriage, from an Indian-American perspective. The main character, Sumita, leaves India for the United States to marry a man she has never met before, and she expresses her anxieties about being exiled from her family. The struggles to adapt to U.S. American culture are symbolically transferred to clothes’ shapes and colors, since Sumita has to trade in her native ‘sari’ for t-shirts and jeans. When Sumita’s husband dies, she is left to choose the life of an independent woman in the United States or return to her in-laws in India. Now a ‘widow in a white sari,’ Sumita vows to stay in the United States despite not knowing how she will survive. Through dance and music that intertwines delicate movements with a subtle but strong body, storytelling transmits the complexity of a female identity that moves between tradition and modernity. The characters’ gestures, and the music, dance, and percussion through the play, reveal a story that is part of a broader history of cultural encounters.
=520  \\$aChitra Banerjee Divakaruni is an award-winning author, poet, activist and teacher. Her themes include the Indian experience, contemporary U.S. America, women, immigration, history, myth, and the joys and challenges of living in a multi-cultural world. Her books have been translated into 29 languages, and her work has appeared in over a hundred magazines and anthologies. Several of her novels and stories have been made into films and plays. She has won an American Book Award and a Light of India award. Divakaruni teaches Creative Writing at the University of Houston and writes for both adults and children.
=520  \\$aFrom 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a ‘new world’—one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting demographics. From a geographic ‘outpost’ in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, methods, and production.

=520  \\$aThe tape shows bits of 'El Quijote', theater piece by Colombia's Teatro La Candelaria; it also presents Santiago García explaining his perspective on the work and his own staging. Speaking about his creative process, García tells how he read the book over and over in search of dramatic parts, trying to find events and adventures in the play that were not well-known to the public. He found twelve scenes that interested him and started elaborating on them, working closely and experimentally with the actors. He also comments on the work of Pedro Alcántara, the person in charge of the visual aspects of the play, to which Santiago García gives a lot of importance. After García's intervention, the tape shows different scenes of the play. Humorous skits, the excerpts evidence how costumes, puppets and choreography play a crucial part in La Calendaria's staging of 'El Quijote'. Santiago García then explains what the figure of El Quijote means to him: he sees great powers of vision in Quijote's madness. La Candelaria (www.teatrolacandelaria.org.co) was founded in 1966 by a group of independent artists and intellectuals who came from experimental theater and the broader Colombian cultural movement. Directed by Santiago García, La Candelaria is one of Colombian theater's most innovative agents, modernizing national drama while addressing popular audiences. By means of an ongoing exploration of national folklore, situations and characters, they have created some of Colombia's most compelling plays, some of them through the method of 'creación colectiva' ('collective creation'), addressing the acute social and political problems of their society. At the same time, they fostered the creation of Corporación Colombiana del Teatro and have developed a number of theoretical works that reflect upon dramatic creation, its methods and languages. Still nowadays, La Candelaria is committed to repertoire, experimentation, and discussion as fundamental elements to artistic creation.

=520  \\$a‘Vivir muriendo’ is a cabaret-format show, where Astrid Hadad performs a direct political satire against the aftermath of Carlos Salinas de Gortari and Ernesto Zedillo’s Mexican government. Hadad’s iconic and continuously morphing clothes are an allegory of Mexican nation, condensed in her body and her powerful voice. Playing in the intertwining relationship between politics and sexuality, ‘Vivir muriendo’ is a thermometer of the Mexican political situation at the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century.
=520  \\$aAstrid Hadad is a vocalist and performance artist from Mexico. Her work as a solo performance artist took off in 1995 with her show ‘Heavy Nopal.’ The term ‘heavy nopal’ refers to the Mexican cactus distilled to make tequila and is how Hadad describes her style of performance. Her shows follow the format of a cabaret, in which Hadad dazzles her audience with stunning vocals and elaborated costumes. She appropriates iconic images in Mexican culture, straps them to her body, and walks onstage to reconfigure their meanings. Through her voice and her body, Hadad challenges to her audience to adopt her system of cultural processing. Most of her work challenges cultural norms pertaining to gender roles in Mexican society. She also addresses issues of US neo imperialism. Hadad writes, produces, and promotes her own work.

=520  \\$aInspired by the 'Glamours' text of Alice Bailey, Deborah Hunt's 'Las Mirillas' talks about the attraction to illusion. A pilgrim, fisherman, guard, sleepwalker, witness and market woman shared two store windows and the space in between to explore the distortion of perception. The video projections allowed the public to see them in their natural habitats. This is Deborah Hunt's fourth work in the shop windows of an art supplies store in Santurce. It forms part of the body of work created by the artist in these windows as a response to having no permit to perform in the plazas (public squares) of San Juan. The spaces were small. It rained. The audience crept closer to huddle around the fire of the pilgrim.

She has worked in New Zealand, USA, England, Mexico, Central America, Puerto Rico, British Windward Islands, Argentina, Denmark, Norway, Belgrade, Venezuela, Cuba, Spain, Singapore, Australia, and has been working bilingually (English/Spanish) since 1985.

Through parody and satire, Fulana explores themes that are relevant to Latino cultures in the U.S., delving into the nuances that bind our experiences, experimenting with strategies to make visible what we're so often made to read between the lines. Their work, which consists mainly of mock television commercials, music videos and print advertisements, responds to the ways products and ideas are marketed to Latinos through the mass media. 'Latino Plastic Cover' is a mock cable access commercial for the ultimate panacea, guaranteed not only to keep dust off your furniture, but to solve all kinds of social ills affecting the Latino community and beyond.

=520  \\$a'Latino Plastic Cover' is the first short film by Fulana (www.fulana.org), a Latina video collective from New York City. Through parody and satire, Fulana explores themes that are relevant to Latino cultures in the U.S., delving into the nuances that bind our experiences, experimenting with strategies to make visible what we're so often made to read between the lines. Their work, which consists mainly of mock television commercials, music videos and print advertisements, responds to the ways products and ideas are marketed to Latinos through the mass media. 'Latino Plastic Cover' is a mock cable access commercial for the ultimate panacea, guaranteed not only to keep dust off your furniture, but to solve all kinds of social ills affecting the Latino community and beyond. Discover the luxury of freedom!

=520  \\$aFrom 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a 'new world' - one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America's shifting demographics. From a geographic 'outpost' in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, methods, and production. One of New WORLD Theater’s artistic legacies is Project 2050, a multi-year youth arts initiative built on the demographic projection that people of color would become the majority in the United States by 2050. The program brought together professional artists, youth communities from Massachusetts, scholars, and community activists to engage civic dialogue and create original performances based on themes that addressed young performers' dreams and concerns. Performances were created from workshops that included playwriting, poetry, breakdancing, drumming, beatboxing, lyricism, singing, songwriting, stepping, and visual art.
=520  \\$aIn 'Umoja,' young members from Project 2050 perform monologues exploring social issues ranging from immigration to women’s liberation. The use of different languages bring together their roots and their future, placing them in-between tradition and futurity. Diverse stories travel from individualities to the history of entire communities: One young performer reflects on her experience as a Vietnamese immigrant pursuing the 'American Dream.' Another young performer discusses his inter-racial identity from a Colombian perspective. Another young performer states her views about feminism from a 'dark girl's perspective.' Among all these different struggles and dreams, there are points of contact and similarities that set the ground for a better future. Thus, the performance ends with the performers collectively dancing and chanting harmoniously in their diversity.

=520  \\$aFOMMA - Fortaleza de la Mujer Maya - is a collective of Mayan women who use theater as a tool for education and community building. They are performers, playwrights, and teachers who tour their work in their communities and internationally, performing plays that focus on women's and indigenous rights, literacy, cultural survival, ecology, health, and education in the Tzeltal and Tzotzil indigenous languages. 'Échame mano que te pagaré' is a play about community building and the exercise of rights within the field of economy as seen in different situations that are connected in the play. After being repeatedly cheated in regards to commerce and money loans, a group of women decide to follow the lead of a friend and attend the workshops offered at FOMMA where they learn the necessary tips to not be deceived again. The video includes interviews with Isabel Juárez Espinosa and Petrona de la Cruz Cruz.

=520  \\$aVideo companion to the lecture "El Taller Como Principio y Fin / Workshop as Process and Product" delivered by Rosa Luisa Márquez and Antonio Martorell at the 1st Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, held in Brazil in July 2000 (www.hemisphericinstitute.org/eng/seminar/brazil/index.shtml). As suggested by its title, and illustrated with abundant footage from actual work by the artists, the video is a documentary on the role of the workshop as a creative and pedagogical tool for the creation of collaborative graphic-theatrical performances. Rosa Luisa Márquez (www.marquezmartorell.org) is a Puerto Rican theater artist and pedagogue. Founding member of the theater group Anamú in 1971, she holds a Master's degree from New York University and a Doctorate from Michigan State University; she specializes in contemporary theater. Rosa Luisa started her teaching career at the Theater department of the University of Puerto Rico in 1978. She developed the current curriculum of Drama Activities, which she teaches in her workshops at schools, prisons, rehab centers, women's shelters, nursing homes and community centers. Her directing projects include "Romeo(s) y Julieta(s)", "Historias para ser Contadas", "La Leyenda del Cemí", "Procesión", "Waiting for Godot", "Jardín de Pulpos", "Absurdos en Soledad", "El León y la Joya", among others. In conjunction with Puerto Rican visual artist Antonio Martorell, she created the concept of Itinerant Performers (1987-1990) resulting in twelve productions. Published books include "Brincos y saltos: el juego como disciplina teatral" and "Historias para ser contadas, montaje de Rosa Luisa Márquez". She is a member of the board of directors and pedagogical team for the EITALCs International School of Latin American and Caribbean Theater. Ongoing artistic collaborators include Gilda Navarra and Antonio Martorell (Puerto Rico), Grupo Malayerba (Ecuador), Grupo Yuyachkani (Peru), and directors Peter Shumann (Bread & Puppet Theater, U.S.A.) and Augusto Boal (Theater of the Oppressed, Brazil).

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of Circus Amok's show, 'Come and See for Yourselves', performed in 2000 in diverse NYC parks, squares and other public spaces. The piece revolves around political, social and economic issues at play in American society. Poverty, monopoly of resources and other economic inequalities, along with police brutality, unequal rights for ethnic minorities and queer communities, environmental issues, political oppression, trigger-happy urban violence, and American foreign policies are some of the topics here exposed. Through the unveiling of these issues, the piece is an open call for civic activism and empowerment, a demand for justice and for a revision of the coordinates of American democracy, all interwoven in a joyful extravaganza of acrobatic artistry, satiric skill, and good old-fashioned circus fun. Circus Amok (www.circusamok.org) is a New York City based circus-theater company whose mission is to provide free public art addressing contemporary issues of social justice to the people of New York City. Directed and founded by Jennifer Miller, the group has been together since 1989 bringing its funny, queer, caustic and sexy, political one-ring spectacles to diverse neighborhoods throughout the city. Over the years the traditional circus skills - tight rope walking, juggling, acrobatics, stilt walking, clowning - have been combined with experimental dance, lifesize puppetry, music old and new, and gender-bending performance art and improvisational techniques, creating new meanings for circus while continuing to entertain the crowds of all ages throughout the city streets, gardens, parks, and playgrounds, inviting the audience to join them in envisioning a more empowered life of community interaction while enjoying a queer celebratory spectacle.

=520  \\$aPeru's most important theater collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. Yuyachkani is a Quechua word that means I am thinking, I am remembering; under this name, the theater group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru. Their work has been among the most important in Latin Americas so called New Popular Theater, with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy. Yuyachkani won Perus National Human Rights Award in 2000. Known for its creative embrace of both indigenous performance forms as well as cosmopolitan theatrical forms, Yuyachkani offers insight into Peruvian and Latin American theater, and to broader issues of postcolonial social aesthetics.In this pedagogical demonstration, presented in the context of the first Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, held at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 2000, Teresa Ralli and Miguel Rubio explain Yuyachkanis acting process. The artists discuss the training of the actors body, as well as voice and character development; body training stresses body memory, composition and accumulation. This pedagogical demonstration also includes aspects of character development, discussing the relationships between everyday body practices and bodies onstage; weight, balance, volume, flows of energy and centers of balance, showcased in this demonstration, are central aspects in Yuyachkanis (re)search of what they term an actor múltiple or multiple actor. The interplay between technique and sensitive/bodily memory is central to the acting and pedagogical work of this Peruvian theater group.

=520  \\$aInterview with Teresa Ralli, founding member of Grupo Cultural Yuyahckani, conducted by Diana Taylor in the context of the first Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, held at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 2000. Ralli discusses the role of women in Yuyachkani in the context of issues of politics and gender in Peru. Topics covered include womens role in society, the difficulty of making a living as professional female theater practitioners, and how the women artists work with Yuyachkani provides them with a space for self-reflection about these roles and also the space to play with/challenge them. For the artist, theater has been a space for personal growth, aesthetic exploration, and social intervention. Teresa talks about the interplay between Yuyachkanis workshops with Peruvian women (dealing with issues of sensibility, bodily awareness, and memory), their theater performances, and their political activism in Peru, both in terms of the internal workings of Yuyachkani and with their audience. She comments on the Encuentro Nacional de Actrices (a conference/event that brought together various Peruvian female performers of Peru), the celebration of the Primer Festival Teatro Mujer (the first major theater festival by women in Peru), the creative and political environment surrounding the creation of Yuyachkanis all-women piece La primera cena (directed by Ralli), and the role Peruvian women play in the creation and performance of her one-woman piece Antígona. Perus most important theater collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. The theater group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru, with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy.

=520  \\$aIn 2000, New York City’s SummerStage hosted a unique concert where three powerful women offered the best of their repertoire. Astrid Hadad, Liliana Felipe, and Eugenia León performed both individually and together, in a show organized and directed by Jesusa Rodríguez. The presence of these women in Central Park, singing in Spanish, speaks about the intertwined relationship between the local and the transnational, as well as the interest in Latin American and Latino/a culture in New York City. The political strength of this performance comes from the voices, the bodies, and the words of these amazing women. This video documentation includes mostly Astrid Hadad’s participation in the show, as well as a grand finale where she and Liliana Felipe and Eugenia León delight the audience with smart and fun rancheras.
=520  \\$aAstrid Hadad is a singer and actress, graduated from Mexico City's Centro Universitario de Teatro. She looks to cabaret and performance to represent social, cultural, and political crisis in Mexico and, at the same time, to entertain. Costumed in her signature wearable art, Hadad blends popular songs and ranchero, son and bolero music and political satire with highly theatrical precision to create a genre of music she calls 'Heavy Nopal'. Her work takes on the stereotypes of Mexican culture and reframes them to comment on the forms of machismo in a variety of local and global contexts. Eugenia León is a singer born in Mexico, defined as a singer committed to the people and their causes. She has performed all around the world and her repertoire includes diverse genres, such as tango, bolero, norteño, Latin American music and rancheras. The strength and versatility of her voice makes her one of the most beloved and recognized Mexican singers. Liliana Felipe is a composer, singer, actor, tango musician, and clergyphobe. She left Argentina for Mexico just before the military coup in 1976, but her sister and brother-in-law remain among the 30,000 disappeared. She and her partner, Jesusa Rodríguez, owned and operated El Habito and Teatro de la Capilla, alternative performances spaces in Mexico City. Jesusa Rodríguez is a Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur and social activist, who has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Her ‘espectáculos’ (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and ‘carpa,’ to performative acts within political projects.

This one-woman performance of José Watanabes version of Sophocles classic tragedy is a breathtakingly sad example of the devastation twenty years of civil violence in Peru caused; although it is the story of only one character, it speaks for the nearly 70,000 disappeared men, women and children of Peru.

=520  \\$aFrom September 26-29, 2000 on the campus of the University of Massachusetts, New WORLD Theater convened a major national and international gathering, ‘Intersection II,’ a conference/performance festival focused on interdisciplinary and intercultural theater work. ‘Intersection II’ included international participation, while examining innovative theater practice within community, and national and global spheres. The event brought together artists, intellectuals, theater producers, arts presenters, and arts activists to explore the process, evolution, and dynamics of making theater in the dawning moments of the 21st century. One of the featured performances was ‘Antígona,’ directed by Miguel Rubio Zapata and masterfully performed by Teresa Ralli, founding member of Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani (Peru). This one-woman performance of José Watanabe’s version of Sophocles classic tragedy is a breathtaking example of the devastation caused by twenty years of civil violence in Peru. Although this is the story of only one character, it speaks for the nearly 70,000 disappeared men, women and children of Peru, and for the thousands of survivors who are still fighting for their right to mourn their loved ones.
=520  \\$aPeru’s most important theater collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. Yuyachkani is a Quechua word that means ‘I am thinking, I am remembering;’ under this name, the theater group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru. Their work has been among the most important in Latin Americas so called New Popular Theatre, with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy.

=520  \\$aFrom 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a ‘new world’—one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting demographics. From a geographic ‘outpost’ in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, methods, and production. One of New WORLD Theater’s artistic legacies is Project 2050, a multi-year youth arts initiative built on the demographic projection that people of color would become the majority in the United States by 2050. The program brought together professional artists, youth communities from Massachusetts, scholars, and community activists to engage civic dialogue and create original performances based on themes that addressed young performers’ dreams and concerns. Performances were created from workshops that included playwriting, poetry, breakdancing, drumming, beatboxing, lyricism, singing, songwriting, stepping, and visual art.

=520  \\$a'The Beauty Way,' in Navajo philosophy, poses that each person was born for a purpose and once that purpose has been found it is his or her responsibility to live up to it. Beauty is to know who you are and to follow that path. Your responsibility is to share the wisdom and knowledge you have gained. This American Indian Community House Indian Summer event, 'Speaking, Singing, Dancing in Beauty,' includes a poetry reading by Clifford Bernie and performance by concert pianist, Tim Hays. George Stonefish speaks about his journey from incarceration to release and concludes the evening by leading the audience in a round dance. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city. AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto 'neighborhood' serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area. 
=520  \\$aThe Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICH's Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980's, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICH's visual and performing arts department programs. Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badger's Corner.   
=520  \\$a'Indian Summer' is an annual event at AICH and an occasion for artists to present their latest works to the community and the general public. All performers, whether new to the field or veteran practitioners, are encouraged to present their work.

=520  \\$aThe Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics held its first Encuentro in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, July 2-15, 2000. Participants included artists, scholars, graduate students, and activists. This eclectic and culturally diverse group, from countries throughout the Americas, captured the spirit of Encuentros: to provide a forum that encourages an interdisciplinary exploration of the relationship between performance and politics from diverse cultural perspectives. This is a video documentation of the opening remarks by Zeca Ligiéro, Diana Taylor, Luis Peirano, and Javier Serna, who introduce the general theme of the first Encuentro, ‘Performance and Politics in the Americas,’ as well as future events.
=520  \\$aThe Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics is a collaborative, multilingual and interdisciplinary network of institutions, artists, scholars, and activists throughout the Americas. Working at the intersection of scholarship, artistic expression and politics, the organization explores embodied practice - performance - as a vehicle for the creation of new meaning and the transmission of cultural values, memory and identity. Anchored in its geographical focus on the Americas (thus ‘hemispheric’) and in three working languages (English, Spanish and Portuguese), the Institute's goal is to promote vibrant interactions and collaborations at the level of scholarship, art practice and pedagogy among practitioners interested in the relationship between performance and politics in the hemisphere.

This eclectic and culturally diverse group, from countries throughout the Americas, captured the spirit of Encuentros: to provide a forum that encourages an interdisciplinary exploration of the relationship between performance and politics from diverse cultural perspectives. This is a video documentation of the welcoming by Marcos Terena, member of the Terena indigenous people, who discusses the political implications in the theorization and practice of ‘indigenous performance’ and intercultural encounters. He remembers the invasions and colonization of indigenous populations, and the ongoing history of dispossession that still affect indigenous communities. Marcos Terena’s perspective, however, is inclusive and open towards multi-cultural encounters as the ones promoted during the Hemispheric Institute Encuentros. For him, to be respected in our differences provides a ground for dialogue and learning.

=520  \\$aFrom 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a 'new world' - one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America's shifting demographics. From a geographic 'outpost' in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, methods, and production. One of New WORLD Theater’s artistic legacies is Project 2050, a multi-year youth arts initiative built on the demographic projection that people of color would become the majority in the United States by 2050. The program brought together professional artists, youth communities from Massachusetts, scholars, and community activists to engage civic dialogue and create original performances based on themes that addressed young performers' dreams and concerns. Performances were created from workshops that included playwriting, poetry, breakdancing, drumming, beatboxing, lyricism, singing, songwriting, stepping, and visual art.
=520  \\$aIn 'Ashy Ankles,' Project 2050's young performers explore oppressive statements around race and gender that they have experienced as young women of color. This oppression is clearly structural when discrimination comes from the ones who must take care of youth and must empower students: the teachers. Repeating the line 'lies my teacher told me' with vigorous sound and noise, the young performers on stage materialize the contradictions and isolation they confronted within an education system intended to replicate the same spiral of abuse and discrimination that pervades society. The young women weave chorus song and wording with quickstep movement, thus being empowered by their bodies and voices. They re-appropriate the oppressive statements and affirm their identities from their own viewpoints as women of color, and unveil their teachers' oppressive gesture claiming that 'they lied.' The piece ends with the young women stating 'they lied' to point out the false truth of the oppressive statements projected onto them, and defying any pretended determination of their future, showing themselves as creative and strong human beings. By inviting the audience with the statement 'look at me know,' they demonstrate that social change is possible from and through each empowered individual.

Difference in opportunities based on class, spread violence, the AIDS pandemic, racism, amongst other social and political issues, are embodied on stage and transmitted as concrete realities. The performers intertwine these issues to their own lives through narrative, gesture and song, building little pieces of a social fabric – and addressing a society where they are looking for their own place. From this very personal point of view, they critically evaluate how the world is in the present, and what they expect, fear, and hope for the future.

=520  \\$aFrom September 26 to 29, 2000 on the campus of the University of Massachusetts, New WORLD Theater convened a major national and international gathering, ‘Intersection II,’ a conference/performance festival focused on interdisciplinary and intercultural theater work. ‘Intersection II’ included international participation, while examining innovative theater practice within community, and national and global spheres. The event brought together artists, intellectuals, theater producers, arts presenters, and arts activists to explore the process, evolution, and dynamics of making theater in the dawning moments of the 21st century. New WORLD Theater’s conference and festival also examined new work practices by artists of color and showcased multidisciplinary theater pieces on the cutting edge of new aesthetics. This video documentation of the inauguration and welcoming of ‘Intersection II’ shows how the event bridged the worlds of creativity and scholarship, community activism and professional performance. Roberta Uno discusses the social politics of New WORLD Theater in the same space where Mildred Ruiz enacts this vision and mission through her songs. This event is an example of commitment to further national conversations on cultural equity, emerging aesthetics and activism through the arts.
=520  \\$aFrom 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a ‘new world’—one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting demographics. From a geographic ‘outpost’ in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, methods, and production. One of New WORLD Theater’s artistic legacies is Project 2050, a multi-year youth arts initiative built on the demographic projection that people of color would become the majority in the United States by 2050. The program brought together professional artists, youth communities from Massachusetts, scholars, and community activists to engage civic dialogue and create original performances based on themes that addressed young performers’ dreams and concerns. Performances were created from workshops that included playwriting, poetry, breakdancing, drumming, beatboxing, lyricism, singing, songwriting, stepping, and visual art.

=520  \\$aFounded in 1965 by Luis Valdez, El Teatro Campesino (www.elteatrocampesino.com) was initially the cultural wing of the United Farm Workers union in California's central valley. With a pointed political mission, ETC performed their 'actos' in the fields, agitprop improvisations communicated eloquently with the workers, who could neither read nor write, but recognized themselves and their values in the actos. By 1970 ETC had gained an international reputation, with major contributions to Chicano culture in the U.S. and to the development and expansion of the boundaries of theater everywhere. Theirs is a popular theater rooted in the American streets, early California history, Mayan/Aztec mythology and Mexican folklore and spiritualism, all geared toward expression of social, political and cultural perceptions. This video documents ETC's play 'Bernabé.' Written in 1970 and revived in 2000, the action of the piece takes place in the small fictional town of Burlap, located in the central San Joaquin Valley of California. With a population of only a couple of thousand inhabitants, Burlap is the hometown of Bernabé, a mentally retarded farm worker who is 'touched by cosmic madness.' The performance takes us from the sun-baked reality of the valley into the mythological darkness of Bernabe's mind. The abstract set reflects the world of its protagonist, blending myth and reality, above and below the surface of the earth. Burlap, California is also the setting for another Luis Valdez' play, 'Mundo Mata,' a period piece that exposes the raw realities of life in a small farmworker town.

=520  \\$aA group of writers are in the habit of gathering in a public library to engage in creative writing and to exchange opinions about their musings. Gradually, life and fiction merge into a discourse blending experiences lived and imagined. Themes like love, death and revolution are lived and recreated in a constant game of imagination; the characters defend the library as a space of fantasy against the real world outside. The only reference we have of this outside world is a constant rain of ashes - we could suspect it being Quito, Ecuador, where volcanic ashes shower the city, but this is only an ambiguous allusion, for this library can exist anywhere and nowhere. This video documents key excerpts from Malayerba's renowned production. The Grupo de Teatro Malayerba (teatromalayerba.org) was founded in Quito in 1979 by Arístides Vargas, Susana Pautasso and María del Rosario 'Charo' Francés, immigrant actors originally from Argentina and Spain. From the start, Malayerba included actors with various backgrounds and nationalities, invested in the exploration of the rich cultural diversity and complex history of Ecuador, as well as issues of migration, exile, political violence and individual and collective memory. With over 25 years of ongoing theater practice and more than 20 plays performed locally and internationally for a diverse audience, Malayerba is committed to theater pedagogy and experimentation, artistic collaboration, and community building. They have represented Ecuador in national and international theater festivals; they have also collaborated with theater groups within Ecuador and in other countries, and performed for both film and television, while engaging in community work in Quito. In 1989 the group created the Laboratorio Malayerba, committed to the training of generations of young Ecuadorian actors and to an ongoing investigation of theories and practices of experimental theater. In 2001 Malayerba launched the theater journal 'Hoja de Teatro,' conceived as a forum for the theorization, criticism and dissemination of Ecuadorian theater practices. The group also runs a theater house, the Casa Malayerba, which houses the Laboratory as well as a theater with seating capacity for seventy people. Malayerba approaches theater making as an artistic, ethical and technical realm where to engage in meaningful creative experiences through which to understand, assume and confront current sociopolitical processes. In working together, actors with various backgrounds and nationalities have shown that a multicultural blend is not only possible but also enriching, as differences lead to new identities, embodiments of dreams, memories, absences and pains that are at once local and universal.

=520  \\$aSince 1981, the Split Britches Company (founded by Lois Weaver, Peggy Shaw, and Deb Margolin, www.splitbritches.com) has written and performed in trio, duet, and solo, as well as collaborated and performed with other artists. They describe their work in this way: 'Our work is rooted in popular culture, but positioned against it. It relies on moments rather than plot, relationships rather than story. It depends on the surprise of transformation rather than the logic of psychological narrative. It straddles the line between performance and theater, exploiting theatricality while exposing the pretense. It is about a community of outsiders, queers, eccentrics. It is feminist because it encourages the imaginative potential in everyone and lesbian because it takes the presence of lesbian on stage as a given.' Their vaudevillian satirical gender-bending performances have received numerous awards, including a Jane Chamber award and four Village Voice OBIE awards. 
=520  \\$aTheir collection of scripts, 'Split Britches Feminist Performance/Lesbian Practice', edited by Sue Ellen Case, won the 1997 Lambda Literary Award for Drama. 'Salad of the Bad Café' is a postmodern cabaret written and performed by Lois Weaver and Peggy Shaw of Split Britches and Asian American performance artist Stacy Makishi. Inspired by Carson McCullers' story 'The Ballad of the Sad Café' and the lives of Tennessee Williams and Yukio Mishima, it is a treatise on love in a post-claustrophobic era. The play begins in 1945, in the summer that lay between the war and the postwar period when Japan was weeping, the American South was seething and the word 'gender' was mostly used in grammar class.   
=520  \\$aThe setting is a café where people come to spend a few hours so that the 'deep bitter knowing that their life is not worth much can be laid to rest.' Racial, gender and regional stereotypes such as 'the drunken homosexual writer, the gender outlaw, the homo-erotic cowboy, the reluctant lesbian bride, the mutant refugee, the faded southern belle, the geisha and the soldier,' come together to tell a story of unrequited love, in an attempt to demystify the Queer, disorient the Orient and demythify the Southern Gothic and the American Grotesque. This is one of the most recent versions of the piece, performed in Boston in 2000.

A different setting from a theater, the museum space invites a more intimate performance, with minimal stage design, and bare white lighting. The ensemble performs excerpts of work-in-progress pieces, particularly ‘Slanguage,’ a comment on the issues of poverty, family, drugs, racism, and street violence, yet finding hope in the contemporary urban landscape, and believing in the power of language to create social change through collective words, stories, and narratives.
=520  \\$aUniverses is a New York-based poetic theatre ensemble company of multi-disciplinary writers and performers who fuse poetry, theater, jazz, hip-hop, politics, down home blues, and Hispanic boleros to create moving, challenging and entertaining theatrical works. The group breaks traditional theatrical bounds to explore new ways of making theater. Founded in New York in 1996, the members of Universes came together in the urban poetry scene of the late 1990s. Through sessions at the New York Theatre Workshop and residencies with New WORLD Theater, their work is now internationally acclaimed. They have performed at venues throughout the United States and toured extensively world-wide.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of DanzAbiertas performance Chorus Perpetuus presented as a part of the 2nd Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, celebrated in June of 2001 in Monterrey, Mexico under the title Memory, Atrocity and Resistance. Chorus Perpetuus is a fascinatingly comic, playful, but also sad reflection on freedom, collectivity, and the necessity of responsible action. DanzAbierta sings and winds itself wordlessly through Gershwin, Mozart, Pergolesi, and Simons and only interrupts itself as one or the other dancer breaks out of the line, fails to meet the tone and steps into action individually. To the repeated question ¿Por qué te vas? (Why are you leaving?), this choreographic work explores the tightrope balancing acts between the individual and the collective, their affects and perils, their complex ethical and political implications. Founded in 1988 by Marianela Boán, the Cuban dance company DanzAbierta has presented internationally at festivals and on tours in Latin America, Europe, and Asia. The award winning dance company is known for its unique style mixing artistic expressions of theater, the visual arts, and singing. Marianela Boán graduated from the National School of Dance in 1971 and received a degree in Hispanic Literature and Language from Havana University in 1981. For 15 years she worked as a dancer and choreographer for the dance company, Contemporary Dance of Cuba, which toured internationally. In 1988, she founded DanzAbierta where she has created a signature style mixing visual arts, theater, singing and music with dance to work through harsh contemporary conflicts. She calls her style 'danza contaminada' (polluted dance). Her other choreography works have included the Cuban National Ballet, Venezia Balleto, and film works in Cuba, Canada, and Spain.

=520  \\$aUniverses is a New York-based poetic theatre ensemble company of multi-disciplinary writers and performers who fuse poetry, theater, jazz, hip-hop, politics, down home blues, and Hispanic boleros to create moving, challenging and entertaining theatrical works. The group breaks traditional theatrical bounds to explore new ways of making theater. Founded in New York in 1996, the members of Universes came together in the urban poetry scene of the late 1990s. Through sessions at the New York Theatre Workshop and residencies with New WORLD Theater, their work is now internationally acclaimed. They have performed at venues throughout the United States and toured extensively world-wide.
=520  \\$aThe boundary-smashing 'Slanguage' brings together the unique mix of language and culture that is life on the United States' streets. Built loosely around the structure of a subway ride from Brooklyn to the Bronx, this piece synthesizes traditional theater with poetry, storytelling, rap, gospel, jazz riffs, bluesy laments, Spanish boleros, and other poetic forms, to paint a rich portrait of the sights and sounds of New York City. Through 'Slanguage,' Universes integrates theatre and street humor with emotional truth, amplifying the issues of poverty, family, drugs, racism, and street violence, yet finding hope in the contemporary urban landscape, and believing in the power of language to create social change through collective words, stories, and narratives.

=520  \\$aWritten by Enrique Buenaventura and adapted by Pilar Restrepo, Teatro La Máscara's 'Un Episodio Banal' is the story of two sisters confronting the psychological labyrinth of domestic violence. The younger sister, pregnant, seeks shelter in her sister's house and family; while there, she unveils the complex violent dynamics of power, luxury, abuse and denial in which her sister is immersed through her marriage to a mobster. Teatro La Máscara is the oldest - and one of the only - feminist, all-women's theater in Colombia. Founded in 1972 in Cali, La Máscara was a political theater initially comprised of male as well as female actors; by the early 1980s, when only the women stayed and wanted to continue the theatrical trajectory of the group, Lucy Bolaños decided to make La Máscara a women's ensemble fully dedicated to a feminine dramaturgy on gender issues. Committed to feminism and social change, they have stayed true to this mission, despite the many social and economic pressures they've had to endure in an environment plagued by violence and machismo, which constantly seeks to 'invisibilize' their work. Because of their fruitful stubbornness, La Máscara is not only creating and staging plays, but also working with marginalized communities, actively participating in political protests and demonstrations, and being involved in the organization of theater festivals. Through their work, they keep re-thinking women's role in the construction of a peaceful Colombia.

=518  \\$aPerformed in Monterrey, Mexico on June 18, 2001, as part of the Second Annual Hemispheric Institute Seminar entitled Memory, Atrocity and Resistance.
=520  \\$aStarting with a semiotic performative that states ‘this is not a performance,’ this lecture/performance is another turn of the screw of René Magritte’s ‘this is not a pipe’ and Fernando Muñoz’ ‘this is not a cow.’ The relationship between performance and art tradition intertwines with a constant interpellation of the audience, blurring the boundaries between art and life. In the Q&A, Maris Bustamante renders her understanding of what non-objective arts are, and how gender roles can perform in art. A juicy conversation about her trajectory includes insights about gender and sexuality, feminist art, maternity, and her work with Polvo de gallina negra and No-Grupo.
=520  \\$aMaris Bustamante is neo trans post conceptualist strident visual producer. Since her first happening in 1971, Maris Bustamante (1949, Mexico) - a graduate from the Escuela Nacional de Pintura y Escultura La Esmeralda at Mexico City - began ‘a search for non-traditional support’ or what she called ‘non-objective art.’ In 1977, along with other artists, she started a movement of ‘savage vanguard’ called ‘No-Grupo.’ With No-Grupo Bustamante created humored and caustic performances where gender was a major source material. In 1983, Bustamante and Mónica Mayer founded the first feminist art collective in Mexico, Polvo de Gallina Negra (Black Hen Powder) - a name based in the popular belief that black hen’s powder is a protection against evil eye or, in this case, attacks against feminism.

=520  \\$aSusana Cook (www.susanacook.com) is a New York-based Argentinean theater and performance artist. Mainly directed to queer and Latino communities in New York City, Cook's work also encompasses a heated response to broader State policies that oppress communities defined in the intersection of race, gender, and class. In her shows, Cook parodies discourses of power, drawing attention to the close ties between the state, religious and political conservatism, and the military. Cook's plays usually feature all-women casts that defy the normative performance of gender, race, and sexuality. 'The Fraud' was performed after the 2000 controversial elections in the United States. The play addresses the rights that were lost under the Bush administration, when most of the social services were cut off and the poor and marginalized lost the basic support that kept them alive. In the play, the characters experience feelings of loss and confusion. They end up not knowing if they ever had what they think they have lost. The audience is invited to put 25 cents, and a black woman will die, right there, in front of them. During the rest of the scenes, the characters experience apathy, fear, and desperation while dealing with all the dead bodies around them. In the last scene, they 'represent' the people from Third-World countries; the ones who were not called to vote, but that will be affected by the measures enforced by the president of the United States. Because US policies will affect their lives deeply, they claim their right to vote.

=511  0\$aAna Correa, interviewee ; Fernando Calzadilla, interviewer.
=520  \\$aIn this interview, Ana Correa recounts her beginnings with the group, where she found dialogue and openness to create theater. Yuyachkani’s piece ‘Allpa Rayku’ marks the group’s quest for Peruvian deep traditions and the Andean world, as well as Correa’s own identity and connections with her own indigenous roots. Traveling throughout Peru, the group found diverse sources of inspiration for the ‘cholificación’ of their proposal – an aesthetic and political project that encompassed Peruvian local spheres within larger global concerns. The group’s members’ training, and their deep investigation and experience as actors, is intertwined with a self-reflection as a group. Their performances provide a space for marginalized civilians to speak and to be heard, and present the violence suffered by the country in the crossfire between terrorist group ‘Sendero Luminoso’ and the Peruvian Government and Army. The country was devastated by this violence, and sunk in an internal void and fragility. Yuyachkani worked with this, convinced that theater make us better human beings. Correa explains how Yuyachkani actors are companions for the character, who is always in the foreground, and how the group has worked in coordination with popular organizations, NGOs, and communities. She highlights the role of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics’ international events and Encuentros, a space that brings a necessary aperture – a space to sit down together and try to understand each other.
=520  \\$aPeru’s most important theater collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. Yuyachkani is a Quechua word that means ‘I am thinking, I am remembering;’ under this name, the theater group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru. Their work has been among the most important in Latin Americas so called New Popular Theatre, with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy. Yuyachkani won Peru’s National Human Rights Award in 2000. Known for its creative embrace of both indigenous performance forms as well as cosmopolitan theatrical forms, Yuyachkani offers insight into Peruvian and Latin American theater, and to broader issues of postcolonial social aesthetics.

=520  \\$aFOMMA - Fortaleza de la Mujer Maya - is a collective of Mayan women who use theater as a tool for education and community building. They are performers, playwrights, and teachers who tour their work in their communities and internationally, performing plays that focus on women's and indigenous rights, literacy, cultural survival, ecology, health, and education in the Tzeltal and Tzotzil indigenous languages. 'Crecí con el amor de mi madre' is a story about self-improvement and empowerment within a dysfunctional family in which the women, a mother and her daughter, have to deal with the challenges of living with an alcohol addict. The play shows how, mainly because of the mother's efforts, the family overcomes the difficulties and the daughter can lead a better life when she becomes a teacher.

=520  \\$aPolitical street intervention by Guillermo Gómez-Peña (here as a 'Tamed Global Artist' from 'Genoa, San Diego') and American artist/activist Julie Sparling (here as a 'Corporate Dominatrix'), protesting the imprisonment of international border-crossing multimedia performance group Publix Theatre Caravan during the G8 Summit in Genoa, Italy, 2001. A parody of international cultural politics and a critique of racism and police brutality, this performance demonstration was enacted in San Francisco in the context of a series of demonstrations at Italian Consulates around the world. La Pocha Nostra (www.pochanostra.com) is an ever-morphing trans-disciplinary arts organization, founded in 1993 by Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Roberto Sifuentes, and Nola Mariano in California. The objective was to formally conceptualize Gómez-Peña's collaborations with other performance artists. It provides a base (and forum) for a loose network of rebel artists from various disciplines, generations and ethnic backgrounds, whose common denominator is the desire to cross and erase dangerous borders between art and politics, practice and theory, artist and spectator. As of June 2006, members include performance artists Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Violeta Luna, Michelle Ceballos, and Roberto Sifuentes; curators Gabriela Salgado and Orlando Britto; and over thirty associates worldwide in countries such as Mexico, Spain, the UK, and Australia. Projects range from performance solos and duets to large-scale performance installations including video, photography, audio, and cyber-art. La Pocha collaborates across national borders, race, gender and generations. Their collaborative model functions both as an act of citizen diplomacy and as a means to create ephemeral communities of like-minded rebels. The basic premise of these collaborations is founded on an ideal: If we learn to cross borders on stage, we may learn how to do so in larger social spheres. La Pocha strives to eradicate myths of purity and dissolve borders surrounding culture, ethnicity, gender, language, and métier. These are radical acts.

Astrid Hadad, singer and actress, graduated from Mexico City's Centro Universitario de Teatro. She looks to cabaret and performance to represent social, cultural, and political crisis in Mexico and, at the same time, to entertain. Costumed in her signature wearable art, Hadad blends popular songs and ranchero, son and bolero music and political satire with highly theatrical precision to create a genre of music she calls 'Heavy Nopal'. Her work takes on the stereotypes of Mexican culture and reframes them to comment on the forms of machismo in a variety of local and global contexts.

=520  \\$aIn this video documentation of Astrid Hadad 's performance 'Amores Pelos', costumed in her signature wearable art, Hadad blends popular songs and ranchero, son and bolero music and political satire with highly theatrical precision to create a genre of music she calls 'Heavy Nopal'. Her work takes on the stereotypes of Mexican culture and reframes them to comment on the forms of machismo in a variety of local and global contexts.
=520  \\$aAstrid Hadad is a vocalist and performance artist from Mexico. Her work as a solo performance artist took off in 1995 with her show ‘Heavy Nopal.’ The term ‘heavy nopal’ refers to the Mexican cactus distilled to make tequila and is how Hadad describes her style of performance. Her shows follow the format of a cabaret, in which Hadad dazzles her audience with stunning vocals and elaborated costumes. She appropriates iconic images in Mexican culture, straps them to her body, and walks onstage to reconfigure their meanings. Through her voice and her body, Hadad challenges to her audience to adopt her system of cultural processing. Most of her work challenges cultural norms pertaining to gender roles in Mexican society. She also addresses issues of US neo imperialism. Hadad writes, produces, and promotes her own work.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of the participation of Puerto Rican experimental artists Teresa Hernández and Viveca Vázquez at the 2nd Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, titled "Memory, Atrocity, and Resistance", held in Monterrey, Mexico in 2001 (www.hemisphericinstitute.org/eng/seminar/mexico/index.shtml). Long time collaborators, Vázquez and Hernández are also co-founders and directors of Taller de Otra Cosa, Inc., a nonprofit organization committed to the development and production of experimental dance and performance projects. Here shown is Teresa's spectacle "El ser complejo o el complejo del ser", where characters Lic. Perdóname, her sister Perpetua, and art critic and cultural pundit Isabella Fernández (all performed by chameleonic Hernández) satirically explore, diatribe and digress on the complex issues of identity politics and collective memory in contemporary Puerto Rico. Vázquez, in turn, presents her experimental dance piece "Miss Puerto Rico o la isla que se repite", and reads her paper "Baile atroz y coreografía del error", in which she discusses her choreographic coordinates in the context of contemporary experimental dance and performance, particularly in the terms of the current cultural climate in Puerto Rico. Her lecture is illustrated by means of a slideshow, which adds to the multimedia aspect of their performance, along with the projection of the short film/performance piece "Viernes social" (created by Taller de Otra Cosa). Finally, the artists open up the space for a Q&A session with the audience, in which they talk about their ongoing creative relationship and the exploits of independent experimental artists in this day and age.

=520  \\$aThe People's Poetry Gathering, co-sponsored by City Lore and the American Indian Community House Writer's Circle presented an evening of Poetry with Maurice Kenny and members of the Writer's Circle. Work was presented by Barbara Snyder (Paiute), Hortencia Colorado (Otomi/Chichimec), Clifford Bernie (Yankton, Sioux), Pena Bonita (Apache/Seminole), Elvira Colorado (Otomi/Chichimec), and Dean Hutchins (Cherokee). Maurice Kenny (Mohawk) was born in Watertown, NY in 1929 and has been a part of the Native community in New York City for decades. Kenny was educated at Butler University, St. Lawrence University and New York University, where he studied with the eminent American poet, Louise Bogan. In the early to mid-60's he lived in Mexico and the Virgin Islands and moved to Chicago for one year. From Chicago he moved to Brooklyn where he lived until he returned to the Adirondack country of upstate New York. 
=520  \\$aThe Writer's Circle was created to encourage Native writers in the community to develop their talent and has received support and guidance from several eminent Native writers such as Maurice Kenny and Simone Ortiz. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city. AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto neighborhood serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area. The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICHs Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community.   
=520  \\$aThe Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICHs visual and performing arts department programs. Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badgers Corner.

=520  \\$aInterview with Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, conducted by Diana Taylor, founding director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. This interview is a part of a series curated by the Hemispheric Institute, articulated around the question 'What is Performance Studies?' The series aims to provide a multifaceted approach to the often difficult task of defining the coordinates of both a field of academic study as well as a lens through which to assess and document cultural practice and embodied behavior. The contingent definitions documented in this series are based on the groundbreaking experiences and the scholarly endeavors of renowned figures in contemporary performance studies and practice.
=520  \\$aBarbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett is Professor of Performance Studies at New York University, where she is also Affiliated Professor of Hebrew and Judaic Studies. Dr. Kirshenblatt-Gimblett researches performance practice and has published on klezmer music and other topics of Jewish culture, as well as general American culture, aesthetics of everyday life, cookery and performance, ethnography, world's fairs, museum, theater and tourist productions. Her many awards include the Guggenheim Fellowship, Getty Research Institute fellowship, Winston Fellowship at the Institute for Advanced Studies at the Hebrew University, and resident research fellowship at the Center for Advanced Judaic Studies at the University of Pennsylvania. She was designated Distinguished Humanist for 2003 by the Melton Center for Jewish Studies at Ohio State University. She is currently co-convening the Working Group on Jews, Religion, and Media at New York University’s Center for Religion and Media, New York University, with Jeffrey Shandler, and the Jews and Performance colloquium, jointly sponsored by the Jewish Theological Seminary and New York University, with Edna Nahshon.

=520  \\$aRosa Luisa Márquez (www.marquezmartorell.org) is a Puerto Rican theater artist and pedagogue. Founding member of the theater group Anamú in 1971, she holds a Master's degree from New York University and a Doctorate from Michigan State University; she specializes in contemporary theater. Rosa Luisa started her teaching career at the Theater department of the University of Puerto Rico in 1978. She developed the current curriculum of Drama Activities, which she teaches in her workshops at schools, prisons, rehab centers, women's shelters, nursing homes and community centers. Her directing projects include 'Romeo(s) y Julieta(s),' 'Historias para ser Contadas,' 'La Leyenda del Cemí,' 'Procesión,' 'Waiting for Godot,' 'Jardín de Pulpos,' 'Absurdos en Soledad,' 'El León y la Joya,' among others. In conjunction with Puerto Rican visual artist Antonio Martorell, she created the concept of Itinerant Performers (1987-1990) resulting in twelve productions. 
=520  \\$aPublished books include 'Brincos y saltos: el juego como disciplina teatral' and 'Historias para ser contadas, montaje de Rosa Luisa Márquez.' She is a member of the board of directors and pedagogical team for the EITALC's International School of Latin American and Caribbean Theater. Ongoing artistic collaborators include Gilda Navarra and Antonio Martorell (Puerto Rico), Grupo Malayerba (Ecuador), Grupo Yuyachkani (Peru), and directors Peter Shumann (Bread & Puppet Theater, U.S.A.) and Augusto Boal (Theater of the Oppressed, Brazil). 'Historias para ser contadas,' directed by Márquez and created in collaboration with Antonio Martorell and the University of Puerto Rico's Teatro Rodante, pays homage to renowned Argentinean theater director, writer and activist Osvaldo Dragún.   
=520  \\$aLike a three-ring circus, the play is performed in three different styles: 'La historia de un flemón, una mujer y dos hombres' is told by the 'Prince of Denmark's Actors Troupe,' an ensemble of characters from Western drama masterpieces - Hamlet, Oedipus, Charlotte Corday, Colombina, among others; 'La historia de cómo Panchito se sintió responsable de la epidemia de peste bubónica en África del Sur' is performed by a troupe of clowns/ mechanics in an old van-turned-puppet-theater, influenced by Naïve artists and pop culture; 'La historia del hombre que se convirtió en perro' is told - and sung - by a group of Bohemians straight from the 70's Puerto Rican nightlife.

El bolero fue mi ruina is Pregones Theaters adaptation of Manuel Ramos Oteros story Loca la de la locura. The protagonist is a Puerto Rican woman like any other and unlike them all. She is a lovelorn and timeworn artiste, a singer of torch songs, a faded night club entertainer. She is a convicted murderer serving the last days of her sentence at Oso Blanco penitentiary. She is also, biologically speaking, a male. The writer dispenses with pieties on this issue Locas biology is not a scandal but a fact. Loca disputes the notion that an aging male body is no home for a lady. She is vulgar, sentimental, sweet, and always sharp as a tack. She remains loyal to the memory of her beloved Nene Lindo, his brand of tough love, and his inscrutable beauty. Her crime binds them forever in shame and passion. Pregones Theater (http://www.pregones.org). , founded in 1979 in New York City, is dedicated to creating innovative and challenging theater rooted in Puerto Rican traditions and popular artistic expressions. They have performed in 21 states as well as internationally.

=520  \\$aHandheld video documentation of Circus Amok's 'The Medicine Show', performed at Tompkins Square Park in New York City. A joyful extravaganza of acrobatic artistry, satiric skill, and good old-fashioned circus fun, this performance deals with social aspects of health, exploring issues like alternative medicine, the historical portrayal of medicine products through racist propaganda, mortality, worldwide epidemics, and health insurance. In particular, the piece delves into the dark side of pharmaceutical companies' and health insurance companies' capitalist strategies; countering these policies, the piece strongly advocates for universal healthcare and widespread access to indispensable medical resources. Circus Amok (www.circusamok.org) is a New York City based circus-theater company whose mission is to provide free public art addressing contemporary issues of social justice to the people of New York City. Directed and founded by Jennifer Miller, the group has been together since 1989 bringing its funny, queer, caustic and sexy, political one-ring spectacles to diverse neighborhoods throughout the city. Over the years the traditional circus skills - tight rope walking, juggling, acrobatics, stilt walking, clowning - have been combined with experimental dance, lifesize puppetry, music old and new, and gender-bending performance art and improvisational techniques, creating new meanings for circus while continuing to entertain the crowds of all ages throughout the city streets, gardens, parks, and playgrounds, inviting the audience to join them in envisioning a more empowered life of community interaction while enjoying a queer celebratory spectacle.

=520  \\$aTim Miller is an internationally acclaimed performance artist. Miller's creative work as a performer and writer explores the artistic, spiritual and political topography of his identity as a gay man. Miller's performances have been presented all over North America, Australia, and Europe in such prestigious venues as Yale Repertory Theatre, the Institute of Contemporary Art (London), the Walker Art Center (Minneapolis), and the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Miller’s most recent book 1001 BEDS, an anthology of his performances, essays and journals, was published by University of Wisconsin Press in 2006. Miller has taught performance at UCLA, NYU, the School of Theology at Claremont and at universities all over the US. He is a co-founder of two of the most influential performance spaces in the United States: Performance Space 122 on Manhattan's Lower East Side and Highways Performance Space in Santa Monica, CA. After a nine-year stint in New York City, in 1987 Miller returned home to Los Angeles, California where he was born and raised. He currently lives there with his partner Alistair in Venice Beach.
=520  \\$aGlory Box is a funny, sexy and charged exploration of Tim Miller's journeys through the challenge of love, gay marriage, and the struggle for immigration rights for gay Americans and their partners from other countries. From Miller's hilarious grade school playground battles over wanting to marry another boy to the harrowing travails of being in a bi-national relationship with his Australian lover, Glory Box leads the audience on an intense and humorous journey into the complexity of the human heart that knows no boundary. In Miller’s words, ‘I want the pieces to conjure for the audience a site for the placing of memories, hopes, and dreams of gay people's extraordinary potential for love.’

=520  \\$a'Promise of a Love Song' is a collaborative play developed from a four-year exchange between Roadside Theater of Kentucky, Junebug Productions of New Orleans, and Pregones Theater of the South Bronx, and their home communities. A cast of twelve musicians and actors from the three companies meet on stage to discover how rhythms, music, movement and stories illuminate the strengths, struggles, similarities, and differences of three peoples - African American, Puerto Rican, and Appalachian. It is a play about love; a tapestry of stories told from very specific realities and worlds. The stories are: 'Star-Crossed Lovers' (Junebug Productions), 'Silent Dancing' (Pregones Theater), and 'Charming Billy' (Roadside Theater). Founded in 1979 and based in The Bronx, New York City, Pregones Theater (http://www.pregones.org) has performed in more than 400 cities and 13 countries. 
=520  \\$aThe company enjoys citywide recognition for their lasting contributions to the performing arts field and are recipients of numerous distinctions including current Leading National Ensemble Theatre Designation from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Primary Cultural Institution Designation from the New York State Council on the Arts, the New York State Governor's Arts Award, the Culture & Humanities Award from the Center for Puerto Rican Studies, numerous artist and production awards, as well as invitations to appear at international festivals and events. Over the years Pregones has developed a style that combines theater, music and movement, oral and written traditions, and a signature urban sensibility. The ensemble draws from popular Puerto Rican artistic expressions and literature to create and stage its work. Today, Pregones has grown to be one of the leading Puerto Rican/Latino theater theaters in the United States.

=520  \\$aFOMMA - Fortaleza de la Mujer Maya - is a collective of Mayan women who use theater as a tool for education and community building. They are performers, playwrights, and teachers who tour their work in their communities and internationally, performing plays that focus on women's and indigenous rights, literacy, cultural survival, ecology, health, and education in the Tzeltal and Tzotzil indigenous languages. 'La voz y la fuerza de la mujer' presents the role of women in electoral politics. Don Zacarías and Doña Carmelita are the two candidates that are competing to represent the people in the upcoming elections. Zacarías' relationship with his prospective voters is patronizing and disrespectful, while Carmelita has closer ties with the women in the community, a relationship that includes open dialogue and empowerment. Through a flashback, the play narrates how Carmelita, from being part of a family who did not allow her to get an education, became a political leader following her strong will. She ends up winning the elections and the rest of the women are inspired by her example to demand their right for equality, education, and political participation and leadership.

=520  \\$aInterview with Ana Correa and Teresa Ralli, members of Peruvian theater ensemble Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani, conducted by sociologist and Dean of the Universidad Católica's School of Communication Arts and Sciences, Luis Peirano, for Peru's TV Channel 7 show 'Memoria del Teatro.' In this interview, conducted in the context of the celebration of the International Women's Day, Peirano, Correa and Ralli discuss the role of women in Peruvian theater. Topics covered include women's role in society, the difficulty of making a living as professional female theater practitioners, and how the women artists' work with Yuyachkani provides them with a space for self-reflection about these roles, a creative realm where to play with and challenge them. For Ralli and Correa, theater has been a space for personal growth, aesthetic exploration, and social intervention. The artists discuss the interplay between their workshops with Peruvian women (dealing with issues of sensibility, bodily awareness, and memory), their theater performances, and their political activism in Peru, both in terms of the internal workings of Yuyachkani and with their audience. This program includes clips from 'La Primera Cena' (one of Yuyachkani's plays) and the Encuentro Nacional de Actrices (a conference/event that brought together various Peruvian female performers of Peru). Teresa Ralli also discusses her role in Yuyachkani's play 'Músicos Ambulantes,' and the role women artists play in the creation and performance of her piece 'Antígona.' Peru's most important theatre collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani (www.yuyachkani.org) has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. 'Yuyachkani' is a Quechua word that means 'I am thinking, I am remembering'; under this name, the theatre group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru. The group is comprised of seven actors (Augusto Casafranca, Amiel Cayo, Ana Correa, Débora Correa, Rebeca Ralli, Teresa Ralli, and Julián Vargas), a technical designer (Fidel Melquíades), and an artistic director (Miguel Rubio), who have made a commitment to collective creation as a mode of theatrical production and to group theater as a life style. Their work has been among the most important in Latin America's so called 'New Popular Theater,' with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy. Yuyachkani won Peru's National Human Rights Award in 2000. Known for its creative embrace of both indigenous performance forms as well as cosmopolitan theatrical forms, Yuyachkani offers insight into Peruvian and Latin American theatre, and to broader issues of postcolonial social aesthetics.

=520  \\$aMarlène Ramírez-Cancio and Claire Crosby interview Jesusa Rodríguez and Liliana Felipe, who talk about their beginnings both as artists and as a couple. They conceived their wedding as a performative act, which was a symbolic statement against a law in Mexico called “Sociedad en Convivencia” (living together in society). Their wedding was immediately followed by their divorce as a part of a contract that should make the couple’s life easier. As they do not believe in marriage or in a social legalization of affect, Jesusa and Liliana talk about how institutions impose and shape issues as sexuality, gender, and human rights. These two wonderful women speak about how society understands masculine and feminine; they also discuss how their art practice and cabaret performances question women's oppression and inequality of power, and how cabaret can function as a thermometer for political struggles. For them, revolution starts from within ourselves, and then it could expand to transform our world. Jesusa and Liliana ran together the famous El Hábito in Mexico City, where they staged hundreds of shows over the course of fifteen years.
=520  \\$aJesusa Rodríguez is Mexico’s most influential cabaret and political performance artist, and recipient of an Obie Award. Often referred to as a chameleon, Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her work challenges traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass; from Greek tragedy to cabaret; from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera; from revue, sketch and carpa, to performative acts within political projects. Most recently, she heads up the Resistencia Creativa movement in Mexico, whose key strategy is using ‘massive cabaret’ as a tool for political action. Liliana Felipe is a composer, singer, gardener, tango musician, and clergyphobe. She left Argentina for Mexico just before the military coup in 1976, but her sister and brother-in-law remain among the 30,000 disappeared.

=520  \\$aThe main action of the play takes place over a few hours within the confines of a church, centering on the efforts of church caretakers to prepare the statue of Santiago for an annual procession. Due to the war, these three caretakersthe only survivors of the townhave been unable to honor their patron saint for many years. For the Hispanic Mayordomo and his mestiza employee, Bernardina, the procession would restore order and bring meaning back to their lives. Yet, for the subaltern indigenous character, Rufino, to honor Santiago would betray his cultural identity. Rufino thus decides to adopt the language, masks, and clothes of an Andean trickster deity in order to betray the attempt to restage the procession. As the program notes explain, during la Reconquista the figure of Santiago was transformed from a peaceful follower of Christ into the Moor-slaying Patron of Spain; in the Conquest, he became a killer of Indians. Ironically, Catholicism's colonizing force turned Santiago into the holy patron of many Peruvian towns, venerated by the largely native and mestizo population. This production suggests that, although forgotten by most Peruvians, a syncretic connection between Santiago and the Andean god Yllapa motivated this odd veneration. The piece merges dream with reality, past with present, as the memories of the earlier peninsular Reconquest allegorize both the Spanish Conquest of America and the recent guerilla war that ravaged the country for decades. Perus most important theatre collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani (www.yuyachkani.org) has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. Yuyachkani is a Quechua word that means I am thinking, I am remembering; under this name, the theatre group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru.

=520  \\$aInterview with Richard Schechner, conducted by Diana Taylor, founding director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. This interview is a part of a series curated by the Hemispheric Institute, articulated around the question 'What is Performance Studies?' The series aims to provide a multifaceted approach to the often difficult task of defining the coordinates of both a field of academic study as well as a lens through which to assess and document cultural practice and embodied behavior. The contingent definitions documented in this series are based on the groundbreaking experiences and the scholarly endeavors of renowned figures in contemporary performance studies and practice.
=520  \\$aRichard Schechner is a theater director, performance theorist and university professor known for being one of the founders of the academic discipline of Performance Studies at Tisch School of the Arts, New York University. Schechner combines his work in anthropology with innovative approaches to performance of all kinds, including ritual, drama, environmental theater, political rallies, dance, music, etc. in order to consider how performance can be understood not just as an object of study, but also as an active intellectual-artistic practice. He is the editor of TDR: The Journal of Performance Studies. His books include 'Environmental Theater,' 'The Future of Ritual,' 'Performance Theory,' 'Between Theater and Anthropology,' 'Performance Studies: An Introduction,' and 'Over, Under, and Around.' Currently he is working on two books: 'Ramlila of Ramnagar' and 'After the Avantgarde.' As of 2008, his books have been translated into 14 languages. Schechner has been a National Endowment for the Humanities senior research fellow, a Smithsonian Institution research fellow, a Fulbright senior research fellow and a Guggenheim fellow, among other honors. He is also renowned for founding The Performance Group, and is currently the artistic director of East Coast Artists. He has directed plays, lectured, and conducted performance workshops in Asia, South Africa, Latin America, and Europe. Schechner is an honorary professor of the Shanghai Theatre Academy where he leads the Richard Schechner Center.

=520  \\$aFrom 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a 'new world' - one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting demographics. From a geographic 'outpost' in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, methods, and production. One of New WORLD Theater's artistic legacies is Project 2050, a multi-year youth arts initiative built on the demographic projection that people of color would become the majority in the United States by 2050. The program brought together professional artists, youth communities from Massachusetts, scholars, and community activists to engage civic dialogue and create original performances based on themes that addressed young performers' dreams and concerns. Performances were created from workshops that included playwriting, poetry, breakdancing, drumming, beatboxing, lyricism, singing, songwriting, stepping, and visual art.
=520  \\$aThis is a video documentation of one of the first events created by Project 2050, 'More Than One Prison,' where young performers discuss the relationships between youth of color and the prison industrial complex. Performers integrate movement and rhyme, stomp style, to discuss the politics of prisons. They reflect upon prison as an omnipresent institution that affects individual lives, making people social prisoners. If imprisonment pervades so many aspects of life, then they ask: 'how do you know you are free?' Through spoken word and verses created by them, these young performers share with the audience their thoughts about what means being a woman, being a person of color, and being marginalized in a society that lacks opportunities. They make clear that incarceration is not the only way of being in prison, and that social change is necessary to be free of both symbolic and violent forms of oppression.

=520  \\$aIt is the summer of 1973, and the United Farm Workers are fighting for their lives. Led by Cesar Chavez, a march comes to Burlap, California, a fictional tank town in the heart of the San Joaquin Valley. This is the background for playwright, director and El Teatro Campesinos founder Luis Valdez vintage classic, Mundo Mata a period piece that exposes the raw realities of life in a small farmworker town. As part of an epic struggle to achieve victory in union elections among ranches up and down the state, the campaign in Burlap brings together two brothers and pulls them apart. One is Bullet Mata, who returns to his old hometown for the first time in twelve years; the other, his older brother Mundo, a Vietnam veteran. Bullet is a college dropout, turned Chavista sworn to non-violence. Mundo is a drug dealer, secretly hired by two growers to stop Chavez. While the issue of violence versus non-violence becomes a personal matter between the two brothers, Mundo Mata also resonates within a larger landscape of the Civil Rights movement and the Vietnam War. What if Cesar Chavez had been assassinated in 1973? Would history remember him differently? These are some of the questions implied in this gritty drama about the farmworkers struggle for justice. Mundo Mata premiered in 1976 in El Paso, Texas in the Chamizal Theater on the borderline with Juarez, Mexico. After being retired, the play was revived, rewritten and restaged, as documented in this 2001 production.

=520  \\$aFounded in 1965 by Luis Valdez, El Teatro Campesino was initially the cultural wing of the United Farm Workers union in California's central valley. With a pointed political mission, ETC performed their actos in the fields, agitprop improvisations communicated eloquently with the workers, who could neither read nor write, but recognized themselves and their values in the actos. By 1970 ETC had gained an international reputation, with major contributions to Chicano culture in the U.S. and to the development and expansion of the boundaries of theater everywhere. Theirs is a popular theater rooted in the American streets, early California history, Mayan/Aztec mythology and Mexican folklore and spiritualism, all geared toward expression of social, political and cultural perceptions. La Carpa de los Rasquachis was originally produced in 1974, and underwent several revisions until 1976, when it was locked into the definitive version seen in this revival performed by a new generation of ETC actors more than twenty years after its premiere. The carpa (itinerant tent show) presents the epic life story of the farmworker in America. Told through the struggles, frustrations and ultimate victory of a single Chicano, the Rasquachi saga (working-class, underdog) comes alive in corridos (Mexica ballads) that tell of lifes tragedies with an ironic, rollicking earthy good humor. The story follows Jesus Pelado Rasquachi, leaving his own mother and brother in Mexico as he heads for the United States, in hopes of getting rich as a bracero. Misfortune and fate, however, stalks his every footstep, in the guise of El Diablo and La Calavera. Tricked and betrayed at every turn, Jesus Pelado becomes a pathetic comic figure in the hands of the growers, contractors, bar owners, and social workers, and ultimately, the undertaker.

Valdez believes in a total theaterone where an elevation of sensation is achieved through a trinity of music, dance and drama to stimulate a New American Audience, a celebration of cultural diversity. This video documents ETCs play 4 Agitators. Adapted from Bertolt Brechts 'Measures Taken', '4 Agitators' follows four 'camaradas' through their trial where they explain the killing of a young comrade, whose fervor takes precedent over his understanding of true revolution. This ETC production is true to Brechts structure, but was renamed to appeal to modern political agitators. Adapted by Ruben Gonzalez and Lakin Valdez, the translation was updated by Kinan Valdez, with new songs written by Mino Valdez.

Theirs is a popular theater rooted in the American streets, early California history, Mayan/Aztec mythology and Mexican folklore and spiritualism, all geared toward expression of social, political and cultural perceptions. Power to the People was created in 2001 by Lakin Valdez, Kinan Valdez and Ruben Gonzalez. The play is a response to the incidents involving Enron, PG&E and California Governor Gray Davis in 2001, in which a false power crisis created by Enron (who had recently begun to sell power to PG&E) resulted in increased power bills and rolling blackouts for California residents. It was later discovered that there was no power crisis, and California residents felt that Governor Davis had responded poorly to the situationthis and other circumstances led to the historic recall election when Governor Davis lost to Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The creators of the piece wanted to re-examine the historical roots of the Deregulation Bill of 1996. The aesthetic of the Power to the People follows the original ETC style of actos, which the group originally used in the fields during the farmworkers' strikes in Delano, California during the 1960s. This acto was performed up and down California, in collaboration with the Power to the People Coalition. This is a good representation of the future generation of El Teatro Campesino while simultaneously representing ETCs past.

=520  \\$aFounded in 1965 by Luis Valdez, El Teatro Campesino was initially the cultural wing of the United Farm Workers union in California's central valley. With a pointed political mission, ETC performed their actos in the fields, agitprop improvisations communicated eloquently with the workers, who could neither read nor write, but recognized themselves and their values in the actos. By 1970 ETC had gained an international reputation, with major contributions to Chicano culture in the U.S. and to the development and expansion of the boundaries of theater everywhere. Theirs is a popular theater rooted in the American streets, early California history, Mayan/Aztec mythology and Mexican folklore and spiritualism, all geared toward expression of social, political and cultural perceptions. This video documents their piece Solidarity por Vida. Like Power to the People, this piece takes after the original ETC tradition of performing actos in the fields of Delano, California during the farmworkers strikes during the 1960s. It represents ETCs newer generations interpretation of the acto style and was created through the structured writing of Kinan Valdez and Luis Juarez in addition to improvisational methods involving the cast. Solidarity por Vida deals with issues of migration, border crossing and the militarization of the Mexican-American border (particularly in Arizona) during the beginning of 2001. The plays theme would prove to be prophetic, having been written before the issue garnered major media attention in 2006. This production was performed outdoors in San Isidro, Mexico on the border of San Diego, California in April 2001, in the context of a day-long program of political performance that brought together multiple performance groups including ETC.

=520  \\$a'Nuestra Señora de las Nubes' (subtitled as an 'exercise on exile') tells the story of the encounters of two political exiles, Oscar and Bruna, who meet in a nondescript place and time to share memories of their homeland, an ethereal, fictional town called Nuestra Señora de las Nubes (Our Lady of the Clouds). Constantly alternating between present realities and past memories, and with two pieces of luggage as sole belongings, the characters share anecdotes of their experience as exiles, their dreams, needs, frustrations, desires, loves, oblivions and memories. A town that only exists in the memory of expatriates, Nuestra Señora maps the experience of diaspora as an existential condition of permanent uprootedness, in this case inspired by the history of Latin American exile. Exile, in this work, becomes not only the physical loss of one's homeland, but the erosion of one's ability to remain inside one's own memories. Memory as a sort of joint venture, then, allows for the construction of a new territory to belong to, a new homeland of affect where to survive, yearn and remember. The Grupo de Teatro Malayerba (teatromalayerba.org) was founded in Quito in 1979 by Arístides Vargas, Susana Pautasso and María del Rosario 'Charo' Francés, immigrant actors originally from Argentina and Spain. From the start, Malayerba included actors with various backgrounds and nationalities, invested in the exploration of the rich cultural diversity and complex history of Ecuador, as well as issues of migration, exile, political violence and individual and collective memory. With over 25 years of ongoing theater practice and more than 20 plays performed locally and internationally for a diverse audience, Malayerba is committed to theater pedagogy and experimentation, artistic collaboration, and community building. They have represented Ecuador in national and international theater festivals; they have also collaborated with theater groups within Ecuador and in other countries, and performed for both film and television, while engaging in community work in Quito. In 1989 the group created the Laboratorio Malayerba, committed to the training of generations of young Ecuadorian actors and to an ongoing investigation of theories and practices of experimental theater. In 2001 Malayerba launched the theater journal 'Hoja de Teatro,' conceived as a forum for the theorization, criticism and dissemination of Ecuadorian theater practices. The group also runs a theater house, the Casa Malayerba, which houses the Laboratory as well as a theater with seating capacity for seventy people. Malayerba approaches theater making as an artistic, ethical and technical realm where to engage in meaningful creative experiences through which to understand, assume and confront current sociopolitical processes. In working together, actors with various backgrounds and nationalities have shown that a multicultural blend is not only possible but also enriching, as differences lead to new identities, embodiments of dreams, memories, absences and pains that are at once local and universal.

=520  \\$aHistorian, Dr. Robert Venables is professor and Director of American Indian Studies at Cornell University and a well respected member of the New York Native community. Dr. Venables' lecture discusses the cultural differences between European and Indian concepts of land and land ownership. These differences, coupled with the illegal and unjust taking of Indian land have over the years led to many Indian land claims against the United States government. In 1946 Congress created the Indian Land Claims Commission to adjudicate the overwhelming number of cases Indians had filed and were continuing to file. By the time the commission expired thirty-three years later more than a half billion dollars had been awarded. Nevertheless many cases remain pending and many others have yet to be filed. Dr. Venables explains this complicated history and examines both the historical and contemporary issues and the legal relationship between the tribes and U.S. government. 
=520  \\$aAlthough the primary focus is on the Haudenausaunee (Iroquois) his talk includes issues concerning all tribes specifically, citizenship, Indian-to-Indian relationships, and the government's relationship with the tribes today. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city. AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto neighborhood serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area. The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICHs Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists.   
=520  \\$aThrough its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICHs visual and performing arts department programs. Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badgers Corner.

=520  \\$aThis is a video documentation of a performance by EDEMA in collaboration with Carlos Ezequiel Monteros (H.I.J.O.S.) and Pilar Medina (group Contraseña, Monterrey), presented at the second Hemispheric Institute Encuentro in Monterrey, Mexico, in 2001. They got together to expand alliances with groups that work on similar topics: the disappeared people during dictatorships, and the necessity to denounce impunity. EDEMA unveils the trauma of disappeared bodies through the striking the materiality of a body on stage. Sensorial stimuli accompany the bodily presence: sound, noise, percussion, fire, dance are mingled with pictures, videos, and pictures of the disappeared. With this performance, EDEMA points out that forced disappearance is a crime related not only to Latin American dictatorships, but also to democratic governments’ responsibilities: ‘el silencio es cómplice de la ausencia’ (silence is complicit of absence).

=520  \\$a‘I Was Born With 2 Tongues’ was created by the New WORLD Theater Residency, which brought young performers to explore their own artistic voice. In this rehearsal of a slam/spoken word performance, a group of talented young artists discusses the politics of trying to get roles as different body-typed people, and how racial identities might be a challenge. Moreover, their voices made us reflect upon the misogyny women face on a daily basis; family and cultural identity; immigration, race, and nationhood. Although all of them are difficult topics, the power of these voices, and the energy of the performers, offer a glimpse of hope. This video documentation features ‘In America’ by Dennis; ‘Letter to Our Unborn Children’ by Ensemble; ‘Not your Fetish’ by Emily and Anida; ‘Race and I’m Running’ by Dennis and Marlon;‘Morning Papers’ by Marlon; ‘Excuse Me America’ by Anida; ‘Lost and Found’ by Dennis; and ‘Loudmouth Woman’ by Emily.
=520  \\$aFrom 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a ‘new world’ - one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting demographics. From a geographic ‘outpost’ in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, methods, and production. One of New WORLD Theater’s artistic legacies is Project 2050, an early call to imagine the U.S. demographic shift, with people of the future - youth, in equal collaboration with artists and scholars.

=520  \\$aFrom 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a 'new world'-one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America's shifting demographics. From a geographic 'outpost' in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, methods, and production. One of New WORLD Theater's artistic legacies is Project 2050, a multi-year youth arts initiative built on the demographic projection that people of color would become the majority in the United States by 2050. The program brought together professional artists, youth communities from Massachusetts, scholars, and community activists to engage civic dialogue and create original performances based on themes that addressed young performers' dreams and concerns. Performances were created from workshops that included playwriting, poetry, breakdancing, drumming, beatboxing, lyricism, singing, songwriting, stepping, and visual art.
=520  \\$aThis video documentation features Project 2050, giving a detailed explanation of this initiative's goals. Roberta Uno, founder and artistic director of New WORLD Theater briefly describes the reach of the project, and explains the metaphor - and demographic projection - that in year 2050 people of color will out number white people. The video presents teachers from the program, discussing the future of art, race, and aesthetics. Also, the video showcases artistic works created by youth artists involved with Project 2050. In the summer of 2001, these pieces explored identity politics, immigration, incarceration, exploitation, negotiation, and identification as main topics addressed through artistic and activist work. Young performers and their mentors interpellate industrial projects and community survival, discrimination, solidarity, and heritage narratives. The vitality of the youth art program is felt through student testimonials and it is further related to the necessity to make such program accessible in public schools. As it is highlighted in the credits, all students, artists and scholars, counselors, and staff involved in the project worked together to reach 'year 2001 and counting….'

=520  \\$aProject 2050 youth theatre artists presented a series of short works throughout the program. Composed like vignettes, these youth performers present pieces about race, class, immigration, identity politics, and social issues. The youth theatre artists use an array of movement, beatboxing, spoken word, and song, to convey their individual and collective narratives. Racism, prisons, and nationalism are other themes explored in their works. The group works in-between collective struggles and individual stories about themselves. They bring to the stage the same configurations, conflicts, alliances, and acts of solidarity that populate our world. This inspiring evening of short works ends with a hip-hop and breakdance jam session with all youth theatre artists present on stage.

=520  \\$aThis 'radiophonic' play explores the relationship between three people, their desires, sense of loss and isolation. The play unravels as a journey of a man passing through a city, a journey of thoughts and words passing inside the man's head, the passing of a story that ebbs and flows, of history repeating itself, of sense lost and recovered. Voices, in their continuous expression and circulation, turn into the face of history and story, their sound turned fractured gestures. And both faces and gestures get shaped in the solitude of those who listen.The production is configured as a digital voice soundscape with a one-shot, aerial-view video of a billiard table in play (featuring international champion billiard player Jaime Bedoya). Streams of sound, words and disembodied voices evoke repetitions and pulses between memory, affect and influence, murmuring softly of a broken long term love affair, of war, intrigue and exile. One of the foremost artistic companies in Colombia, Mapa Teatro (www.mapateatro.org) has been producing theater, performance and art installation projects since 1984. Founders and directors, Rolf and Heidi Abderhalden have created a wide ranging repertoire of theater, opera, mixed-media performance, and site-specific installation. Their work proposes richly textured visual metaphors in which they consider often complex psychological, social and political relationships. Committed to experimentation, and less interested in the actor as an 'agent of fiction,' they describe their project as 'a laboratory of social imagination,' that offers a space for presenting community issues and human concerns in media and performance. This combination of real-life situations and sites along with highly stylized aesthetic staging produces a tension between real action and (re)presentation. Mapa Teatro draws from live events captured on video such as the demolition of a neighborhood in Bogotá, ritual practice, and texts that explore the relationship of postmodern subjects, myth and metaphor. Mapa Teatro has performed by commissions, festivals and collaborative projects world-wide.

Blanche is based on Tennessee Williams play A Streetcar Named Desire. For many years Marianela Boán admired the character of Blanche DuBois and identified with her from the perspective of a Cuban woman. This Cuban Blanche, who stays on the island while her sister emigrates, holds onto her revolutionary dreams, just as the original Blanche never loses her aristocratic spirit. Marianela Boán graduated from the National School of Dance in 1971 and received a degree in Hispanic Literature and Language from Havana University in 1981. For 15 years she worked as a dancer and choreographer for the dance company, Contemporary Dance of Cuba, which toured internationally. In 1988, she founded DanzAbierta where she has created a signature style mixing visual arts, theater, singing and music with dance to work through harsh contemporary conflicts. She calls her style polluted dance. Her other choreography works have included the Cuban National Ballet, Venezia Balleto, and film works in Cuba, Canada, and Spain.

=520  \\$aInterview with Barbara Browning, conducted by Diana Taylor, director and founder of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. This interview is a part of a series curated by the Hemispheric Institute, articulated around the question 'What is Performance Studies?' The series aims to provide a multifaceted approach to the often difficult task of defining the coordinates of both a field of academic study as well as a lens through which to assess and document cultural practice and embodied behavior. The contingent definitions documented in this series are based on the groundbreaking experiences and the scholarly endeavors of renowned figures in contemporary performance studies and practice.
=520  \\$aBarbara Browning is Associate Professor of Performance Studies at New York University. She previously chaired the Performance Studies Department. She received her Bachelor's, Master's and Doctoral degrees in Comparative Literature from Yale University. In 1983 she was awarded a Fulbright fellowship for the study of popular literature in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. Also trained as a dancer, Dr. Browning published her first book, Samba: Resistance in Motion, winner of the de la Torre Bueno Prize for an outstanding work of dance scholarship, in 1995. She went on to write Infectious Rhythm: Metaphors of Contagion and the Spread of African Culture, which was published in 1998. Her articles have appeared in anthologies, as well as such publications as Dance Research Journal, TDR, Dance Chronicle, and Women & Performance. She serves on the boards of directors of both the Congress of Research on Dance and the Society of Dance History Scholars. Dr. Browning is also a member of the editorial board of Women & Performance and the advisory board of DRJ. Her practical training in Brazilian dance was greatly amplified during her Fulbright year in Bahia and led to her further study, instruction, and performance of Brazilian dance in Brazil, the United States, and Europe. She performed for several years with both the Loremil Machado Afro-Brazilian Dance Company and Silvana Magda's Viva Bahia. While no longer performing professionally, she continues to merge practical engagement of body practices with her scholarly work, which broadly addresses performance and politics in the African diaspora.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of Nao Bustamantes solo performance America the Beautiful presented as part of the 3rd Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, celebrated in July of 2002 in Lima, Peru under the title Globalization, Migration and the Public Sphere. America the Beautiful is a body-narrative, which begins with the performer literally setting the stage. Through the rituals of feminine transformation, using clear packing tape and haphazard make-up, Bustamante creates a distorted reality of beauty with all of its eros and defeat. This tragic/comedy takes the viewer on a bizarre circus-like adventure of ladder climbing and breath-holding tension. Nao Bustamante is an internationally known performance art pioneer originating from the San Joaquin Valley of California. Her work encompasses performance art, installation, video, pop music and experimental rips in time. Using the body as a source of image, narrative and emotion, her performances communicate on the level of subconscious language taking the spectator on a bizarre journey, with haunting images, cracking stereotypes by embodying them. Bustamante's work has been presented, among other sites at, the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Arts, and the Kiasma Museum of Helsinki. She has performed in Galleries, Museums, Universities and underground sites throughout Asia, Africa, Europe, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Mexico and the United States. Her collaborations include working with such luminaries as Coco Fusco and Osseus Labrint. In 2001 she received the prestigious Anonymous Was a Woman fellowship. Currently she is living in Troy, New York and an assistant professor of New Media and Live Art at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

This is a shortened piece of the original production of Teatro Esquina Latina, with two actresses instead of the original four. The play is a spectacle of storytelling that creates the scene, for young people and adults, of the daily life, humor, and the game of love in the land that is Africa. Teatro Esquina Latina is a cooperative theatre group from Cali, Colombia, founded in 1973 in the Universidad del Valle as a student group and directed by Orlando Cajamarca Castro.

=520  \\$aSusana Cook (www.susanacook.com) is a New York-based Argentinean theater and performance artist. Mainly directed to queer and Latino communities in New York City, Cook's work also encompasses a heated response to broader State policies that oppress communities defined in the intersection of race, gender, and class. In her shows, Cook parodies discourses of power, drawing attention to the close ties between the state, religious and political conservatism, and the military. Cook's plays usually feature all-women casts that defy the normative performance of gender, race, and sexuality. 'Hamletango, Prince of Butches' is an adaptation of 'Hamlet, Prince of Denmark' for an all-women's cast. In this play, all the original elements of Shakespeare's play appear rearranged, transformed. Here, the prince is a woman and the ghost is her mother. If in the original drama the ghost of the father comes back asking his son for revenge, causing a tragedy where everybody dies, in this version the ghost of the mother does not come back asking for revenge. Ophelia appears here as a good swimmer, but the audience still witness her funeral - and so does she, next to the other characters, bringing together the living and the dead, ghosts and ashes. The tragedy, then, becomes a comedy. At the end of the drama - as in the original 'Hamlet' - a group of clowns comes to tell 'what really happened.' Represented as peasants who just witnessed the death of the whole royal family in the hands of each other, the clowns find themselves in a palace full of clothes, food, and wine, without a King, a Queen, or a Prince. So they dress with their clothes, drink their wine, and celebrate.

'Spic' is the ethnic slur applied to Latinos and Hispanics in the US. In the piece, which explores the borders between the 'inner' and the 'outer' world, death appears as just one more element of life. The show is organized in a series of monologues that describe the character's journey in search of God, Truth, Justice, Friends, True Love, and True Gender. The protagonist ends up finding the frontiers of the social body, looking for a job, trying to survive in a corporate world. Includes Cook's 'Lemon Cookies' Monologue.

=520  \\$aStreet action created by Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani in May 2002 and performed during the 'Semana Anticorrupción' (AntiCorruption week) in Lima, Peru. After the fall of the Fujimori Presidency in 2001, the extent of governmental corruption and its key players were being exposed, by means of documentation which demonstrated that members of Fujimori's Cabinet had accepted bribes, in addition to embezzling a great amount of money during his presidency. In this street action, members of Yuyachkani perform a critique to the abuses of power and the financial corruption that took place within Fujimori's government: the actors dance to the well-known 'El baile del Chino' (a 'tecnocumbia' song used by Fujimori for his third electoral campaign), wearing masks to represent some of these political figures, including Fujimori, Montesinos, the Mayor, the Minister, a Congresswoman, a representative of Judicial Power, the Assessor, Owners of Mass-Communication, the Military and the Grupo Colina (a paramilitary group). The group toured around Lima in a small bus which they called 'El Bus de la Fuga' ('Escape Bus'), from Barrios Altos (a neighborhood that suffered the murder to some of its residents) to La Cantuta (where a number of students were murdered) to Tokyo (where President Fujimori fled to exile). The route covered both affluent and impoverished neighborhoods of Peru's capital city -including the Palacio de Justicia, the Distrito de Comas, the Parque Universitario, the Universidad Nacional de Educación, Ate-Vitarte, Villa el Salvador, and Miraflores- eliciting the most varied reactions depending on where the street action was performed. Some of these street audience reactions, along with footage of the performance, are documented in this video created by Miguel Piedra. Peru's most important theater collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani (www.yuyachkani.org) has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. 'Yuyachkani' is a Quechua word that means 'I am thinking, I am remembering'; under this name, the theater group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru. The group is comprised of seven actors (Augusto Casafranca, Amiel Cayo, Ana Correa, Débora Correa, Rebeca Ralli, Teresa Ralli, and Julián Vargas), a technical designer (Fidel Melquíades), and an artistic director (Miguel Rubio), who have made a commitment to collective creation as a mode of theatrical production and to group theater as a life style. Their work has been among the most important in Latin America's so called 'New Popular Theater,' with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy. Yuyachkani won Peru's National Human Rights Award in 2000. Known for its creative embrace of both indigenous performance forms as well as cosmopolitan theatrical forms, Yuyachkani offers insight into Peruvian and Latin American theater, and to broader issues of postcolonial social aesthetics.

=520  \\$aIn A Terra, the first impact is the geography of the sertão. Euclides da Cunha describes each part of the sertão in the first part of his book, revealing to the reader an x-ray of the region. In the play, a carnival opera, an epic Brazilian musical, the actors are the earth, the vegetation, the wind, the animals, the rivers, the drought. It reveals the most intimate secrets of nature, that also vibrate in the human and trans-human arteries. When this work returned as a musical overture to the whole pentalogy, enriched by the experience that the subsequent works brought to the creators and to the audience, it gained an updated insight into the human interference in the environment. Destructive power is proportional to financial power, and the discussion about the way space gets occupied was brought to the forefront, including the real-estate boom that surrounds today not only Teatro Oficina, but the whole world, now hotter and more arid.
=520  \\$aFrom 2000 to 2007, Teat(r)o Oficina Uzyna Uzona worked on the staging of Euclides da Cunha's epic book, Os Sertões, which describes the 19th Century War of Canudos in the Brazilian 'sertão,' lead by Antônio Conselheiro. The final result was a pentalogy, formed by the plays A Terra (2002), O Homem I (2003), O Homem II (2003), A Luta I (2005), and A Luta II (2006), totalizing 27 hours of theater. Os Sertões reads the episodes of the war in light of past and present Brazilian history, and in relation to the struggle of the group against media mogul Sílvio Santos, who wanted to tear down the historic theater.

=520  \\$aIn 2001, Rolf Abderhalden of Mapa Teatro was invited by the French Academie Experimentale des Theatres and Anatoli Vassiliev to stage Bernard Marie Koltès' 'Quai Ouest' with Russian actors in the framework of the World Olympics of Theater celebrated in Moscow. The following year, he staged another version in Bogotá. 'Muelle Oeste' tells the story of a random meeting of eight dispossessed people in a warehouse on a pier in a major Western port city (Koltès was inspired by a visit to New York City). Each one of the characters in this underworld is, in their own eyes, subjected to the trading of their needs and desires, holding on to the tatters of their civilized ways. In this production, the architectonic richness of the Teatro Colón in Bogotá provides the conditions of possibility to represent, spatially, each of the eight points of views at play in 'Muelle Oeste' - eight worldviews from eight characters who, uprooted from their homelands, their communities and their ways of life, will negotiate with whatever they got left in order to fulfill their unavoidable fate.
=520  \\$aOne of the foremost artistic companies in Colombia, Mapa Teatro (www.mapateatro.org) has been producing theater, performance and art installation projects since 1984. Founders and directors, Rolf and Heidi Abderhalden have created a wide ranging repertoire of theater, opera, mixed-media performance, and site-specific installation. Their work proposes richly textured visual metaphors in which they consider often complex psychological, social and political relationships. Committed to experimentation, and less interested in the actor as an 'agent of fiction,' they describe their project as 'a laboratory of social imagination,' that offers a space for presenting community issues and human concerns in media and performance. This combination of real-life situations and sites along with highly stylized aesthetic staging produces a tension between real action and (re)presentation. Mapa Teatro draws from live events captured on video such as the demolition of a neighborhood in Bogotá, ritual practice, and texts that explore the relationship of postmodern subjects, myth and metaphor. Mapa Teatro has performed by commissions, festivals and collaborative projects world-wide.

Eleonora Fabiãos Giro Piece is a dance performance, an installation, a scream claiming attention to the body immersed in present times. An awakening call to the body led by, and oppressed by, globalization. Fabião explains, The experience of being a world citizen in the era of globalization produces on me, among many advantages and benefits, a disturbing vertigo, a certain existential dizziness. I am permanently experiencing a tension provoked by the expansion of my body through all communication and transportation systems, and the dispersion of my self while perceiving the vast-virtual worlds web. There is a centrifugal force expanding the body towards space and time, and a centripetal force condensing body and space in a timeless state. Giro Piece is a performance art work that investigates these issues using maps (all kinds: sky maps, world maps, human body maps, subway maps),four televisions, saliva, a dress, a woman-performer and the spectators presence and movement. Performance artist and theorist Eleonora Fabião focuses strongly on the relationship between the audience and performer, using co-labor-a(c)tion to break down the standard active-passive dichotomy. The main thrust of her work is directed towards an exploration of the poetic body and its creative, political and communicative abilities.

=520  \\$aTeresa Hernández is a Puerto Rican stage artist. Since 1987 she has written, directed and performed contemporary theater and dance, both in Puerto Rico's commercial and experimental art scenes. Along with choreographer Viveca Vázquez, she directs and administers the Taller de Otra Cosa, Inc., a nonprofit organization committed to the development and production of experimental dance and performance projects. As a solo artist, she produces her work since 1991 through her organization "Producciones Teresa, no inc.". She also offers workshops, talks and performance demonstrations for high school and college students. Teresa's creative projects are characterized by a consistent eschewing of traditional artistic categories. An excellent example and exploration of her experimental, alternative work is "Infarto" ("Heart Attack"), where theater, dance, performance, dramatic text, movement, costumes, video, animation, projections, music and everyday objects are juxtaposed and confronted, placed in a liminal space where notions of precariousness are explored and celebrated. Along with fellow experimental performers Eduardo Alegría and Yamil Collazo, Teresa exposes the struggles, anxieties and exploits of being experimental artists in Puerto Rico. Forced migration, bigotry, lack of available spaces and proper funding, and the pressure to define their work within fixed boundaries of traditional art forms all pose a daily threat to artists, who metaphorically "infartan" due to these social, political and economic conditions. In turn, the artists celebrate precariousness, the unpolished work of art, the slippery path between disciplines, embracing affect and humor to assert publicly that their work is "a different kind of performance" : "lo mío es otro teatro".

=520  \\$aThe experimental multimedia mask-and-puppet theater piece 'Cloche y el Cuervo II: El Regreso' is a reply to Deborah Hunt's 'Cloche y el Cuervo' the story of an unlikely hero. Cloche, who receives a letter, is propelled along a bizarre journey where his alter egos take the form of seductively malicious crows bent on his destruction. The audience of the first piece liked the crows more than Cloche. Hunt thought they had missed the point so she and her troupe filmed the crow characters in black and white and created seven Cloches.and their revenge or rather counterbattle. Deborah Hunt is a maskmaker, puppeteer and performance artist with 35 years experience in the creation and presentation of original theater and performance works. She has worked in New Zealand, USA, England, Mexico, Central America, Puerto Rico, British Windward Islands, Argentina, Denmark, Norway, Belgrade, Venezuela, Cuba, Spain, Singapore, Australia, and has been working bilingually (English/Spanish) since 1985. Hunt also teaches puppetry and maskwork, offering intensive laboratories lasting from a weekend to nine-months long. Born in New Zealand, residing in Puerto Rico since 1990, she is a member of the Magdalena Project and the Founder and Artistic Director of MASKHUNT Inc, theater of the futile.

=520  \\$aInterview with André Lepecki, conducted by Diana Taylor, director and founder of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. This interview is a part of a series curated by the Hemispheric Institute, articulated around the question 'What is Performance Studies?' The series aims to provide a multifaceted approach to the often difficult task of defining the coordinates of both a field of academic study as well as a lens through which to assess and document cultural practice and embodied behavior. The contingent definitions documented in this series are based on the groundbreaking experiences and the scholarly endeavors of renowned figures in contemporary performance studies and practice.

=520  \\$aRosa Luisa Márquez (www.marquezmartorell.org) is a Puerto Rican theater artist and pedagogue. Founding member of the theater group Anamú in 1971, she holds a Master's degree from New York University and a Doctorate from Michigan State University; she specializes in contemporary theater. Rosa Luisa started her teaching career at the Theater department of the University of Puerto Rico in 1978. She developed the current curriculum of Drama Activities, which she teaches in her workshops at schools, prisons, rehab centers, women's shelters, nursing homes and community centers. Her directing projects include 'Romeo(s) y Julieta(s),' 'Historias para ser Contadas,' 'La Leyenda del Cemí,' 'Procesión,' 'Waiting for Godot,' 'Jardín de Pulpos,' 'Absurdos en Soledad,' 'El León y la Joya,' among others. In conjunction with Puerto Rican visual artist Antonio Martorell, she created the concept of Itinerant Performers (1987-1990) resulting in twelve productions. Published books include 'Brincos y saltos: el juego como disciplina teatral' and 'Historias para ser contadas, montaje de Rosa Luisa Márquez.' She is a member of the board of directors and pedagogical team for the EITALC's International School of Latin American and Caribbean Theater. Ongoing artistic collaborators include Gilda Navarra and Antonio Martorell (Puerto Rico), Grupo Malayerba (Ecuador), Grupo Yuyachkani (Peru), and directors Peter Shumann (Bread & Puppet Theater, U.S.A.) and Augusto Boal (Theater of the Oppressed, Brazil). This video documents a choreographic version of 'Foto-Estáticas.' A collaboration between Márquez and renowned Puerto Rican artist Antonio Martorell, the piece was originally created in 1985 with students of the course Drama Activities at the University of Puerto Rico (Humacao campus) as a performance to complement Martorell's art show 'Álbum de Familia' (Family Album). The piece has since then been restaged several times by the Teatreros Ambulantes de Cayey, touring internationally. The present iteration of the piece is a choreographic version created in collaboration with Puerto Rican contemporary dance company Andanza, directed by Lolita Villanúa. Before the piece starts, the audience is invited to join the artists onstage in creating the characteristic costumes of 'Foto-Estáticas,' an array of garments and props made out of recycled newsprint.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of Circus Amok's show, 'The Experimental Walking Tour,' performed in 2002 in diverse New York City parks, squares and other public spaces. This video shows a composite of the diverse performances given by the troupe, showing the diversity of outdoor spaces and audience members that frame and share the experience of the Circus. 'The Walking Tour' exposes the social implications and political controversies surrounding the implementation of the U.S. Patriot Act, as well as the environment of fear, paranoia, persecution, surveillance, and questionable patriotism resulting from the political climate in the United States after the events of September 11, 2001. The resulting itinerant performance is an open call for critical thinking and civic empowerment, a joyful extravaganza of acrobatic artistry, satiric skill, and good old-fashioned circus fun. Circus Amok (www.circusamok.org) is a New York City based circus-theater company whose mission is to provide free public art addressing contemporary issues of social justice to the people of NYC. Directed and founded by Jennifer Miller, the group has been together since 1989 bringing its funny, queer, caustic and sexy, political one-ring spectacles to diverse neighborhoods throughout the city. Over the years the traditional circus skills - tight rope walking, juggling, acrobatics, stilt walking, clowning - have been combined with experimental dance, lifesize puppetry, music old and new, and gender-bending performance art and improvisational techniques, creating new meanings for circus while continuing to entertain the crowds of all ages throughout the city streets, gardens, parks, and playgrounds, inviting the audience to join them in envisioning a more empowered life of community interaction while enjoying a queer celebratory spectacle.

=520  \\$a"The land is dry, the land is dead": such is the recurring theme in this new version of Euripides' "The Bacchae" by Raquel Carrió and Flora Lauten. Structured in fifteen "cuadros", this new version proposes a contemporary reading of the classic play, turning our attention from the original's preoccupation with guilt and punishment, towards an exploration of the themes and conflicts of exile, migration, the mechanisms of power, popular traditions, and the myths that have been with us from Antiquity to the present. Teatro Buendía, formed in 1986 by graduates from the Higher Institute of Arts, Havana, and directed by Flora Lauten, is Cuba's most celebrated theater company. Since its foundation, they have developed two parallel lines of work: the production of theater spectacles, and a permanent research center investigating Latin American and Caribbean cultural traditions, the expressive possibilities of the actor, and the renewal of scenic languages. The study of the possible relations between music, dance, and interpretation, as well as the formulation of new forms of scenic writing and dramaturgy of the spectacle, have consolidated Teatro Buendía's international prestige as a company that has presented their repertoire in the most demanding festivals and venues of Latin America, Europe, North America, Asia, Africa and Australia, all to critical acclaim. They also tour internationally giving workshops, seminars and conferences on their cultural investigations and creative methods.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of Gigi Otálvaro-Hormillosa's performance 'Cosmic Blood,' presented as part of the 3rd Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, celebrated in July of 2002 in Lima, Peru under the title Globalization, Migration and the Public Sphere. 'Cosmic Blood' explores the concept of mestizaje, a Spanish word used to describe the race mixture of Spanish and indigenous blood as a result of colonialism, from a perspective informed by history, contemporary culture and racial formation and creative, spiritual speculation about the future. The performance aims to illustrate the contradictory aspects of mestizaje in which the genocide and rape of one race led to the creation of a new race. Furthermore, it looks to redefine mestizaje to incorporate mixed race and queer identities, portraying subversive yet fluid identities to dismantle the binaries created by colonial constructs relating to race and gender.
=520  \\$aTheories of contact between ancient civilizations and extraterrestrials influenced the performance artist's vision of a cosmic mestizaje in which the impending transformation of the world as we know it may lead to possibilities for the creation of a new existence and way of being. Gigi Otálvaro-Hormillosa, also known as the Devil Bunny in Bondage, is a San Francisco based interdisciplinary performance artist, video artist, cultural activist, curator and percussionist of Filipino and Colombian descent. She is originally from Miami, Florida and received her B.A. from Brown University where she created an independent concentration entitled 'Hybridity and Performance.' She is currently the Artistic Director of (a)eromestiza, an interdisciplinary arts organization dedicated to presenting experimental video and performance work by queer and/or people of color.
=520  \\$aShe has also worked with non-profit organizations such as Proyecto ContraSIDA Por Vida, New Langton Arts, Galería de la Raza, the Queer Cultural Center, Asian American Theater Company and the Asian Pacific Islander Cultural Center. She has worked on various artistic collaborations under the mentorship and direction of performing artists such as Pearl Ubungen, Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Elia Arce and Afia Walking Tree. Her work in performance, video and writing has been presented nationally and internationally. She has received grants from the Franklin Furnace Fund for Performance Art, the San Francisco Art Commission Cultural Equity Grants Program, the Potrero Nuevo Fund Prize and the Zellerbach Family Fund.

=520  \\$aThe all womens a capella group Ulali performs. Ulali (www.ulali.com), formerly known as Pura Fe, is an a cappella women's trio featuring three Native women singers, Pura Fe (Tuscarora), Soni Moreno (Apache/Mayan) and Jennifer Kreisberg (Tuscarora). Ulali blends a variety of traditional and contemporary indigenous music of the Americas, incorporating political, social and personal issues that affect all of humanity. By fusing outside influences with Native words and music, Ulali challenges notions of how traditional words and concepts are applicable in the modern world. The group can be heard on dozens of albums, documentaries and movies. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city. AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto neighborhood serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area. The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICHs Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICHs visual and performing arts department programs. Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badgers Corner.

=520  \\$aIn this farcical cabaret performance, the 'Four Horsewomen of Apocalypse' perform humanity's war against nature, in a 'metaphysical' reflection on terrorism, surveillance, and the society of spectacle. After the terrorist attacks to New York on September 11, 2001, 'a hope for war is reborn,' along with the imminent and 'longed annihilation of nature.' A group of women volunteer to be locked up at Mega Corporation headquarters ('a product of the global fusion of the market of perfect autocompetition'), in a sorts of 'reality TV' show where metaphysical debates juxtapose with beauty contests, bureaucratic limbos, and theatrical last suppers. 
=520  \\$a'Reach Your Metaphysics 2002' is a beauty pageant where the Four Horsewomen -representing Hunger, Epidemy, War, and Death- are confronted with philosophical questions: what is knowledge? Will? Conscience? The fate of the human species? The contestants then turn into secretaries of a government office where, between gossip and slaking off, they intend to finish their evaluation reports to Mega on how their Ministries (of Abundance, Peace, Truth, and Love) have contributed to the corporation's goal and achievement of 'joyfully destroying' nature and humanity. The women then turn into a satiric version of Federico García Lorca's 'House of Bernarda Alba' dramatic characters, in a supper where the daughters insist in getting Bernarda to tell them The Truth. Bernarda confesses that she is Mother Nature, the Big Mother, who created her offspring in order to mirror and contemplate herself.   
=520  \\$aThe kaleidoscopic play of gazes is thus multiplied, in a vortex of surveillance where Big Mother echoes Big Brother, both as Orson Well's '1984' dystopia and as Mexico's homonymous reality TV show. Metaphysically aggravated, the Horsewomen murder Mother Nature and, left with a barren planet, embark in 'a crusade against alien -extraterrestrial- terrorism.' Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodríguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a 'chameleon,' Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her 'espectáculos' (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and 'carpa,' to performative acts within political projects.   
=520  \\$aHumor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguez's energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances.   
=520  \\$aJesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: 'I am going to die with that woman.' Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. In this off-off space, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas, Jesusa y Liliana have produced hundreds of shows since the 1980s.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of Jesusa Rodríguez, Liliana Felipe and Regina Orozcos New War, New War presented as part of the 3rd Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, celebrated in July of 2002 in Lima, Peru under the title Globalization, Migration and the Public Sphere. In this farcical, multimedia political cabaret/musical theater production, Rodríguez, Felipe and Orozco ask whether humor can elucidate politics in times of crisis and war. The piece was written in particular response to the U.S. war on terror and the build-up to what we now know of the Iraq war of 2003. This performance brigs to the forefront a reflection on six aspects of the War on Terror: the destruction of a cosmic order; a fourth world war in a neo-prehistoric era; a political war in the global village; a genetic revolution; a gender war; and a cultural war. The performance combines multi-media sets with traditional opera from Orozco, music from Felipe and political satire from Rodríguez. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist, Jesusa Rodríguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Her espectáculos (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and carpa, to performative acts within political projects. She and her partner, Argentine singer/actor Liliana Felipe, own and operate El Hábito and Teatro de la Capilla, alternative performances spaces in Mexico City. They have won an Obie for Best Actor in Las Horas de Belén, A Book of Hours (1999) with Ruth Maleczech and New York-based Mabou Mines. Rodríguez contributes regularly to Mexicos most important feminist journal, Debate Feminista. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: I am going to die with that woman. Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito. They 'married' in February, 2000. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). Regina Orozco (La Megabizcocho) is a Mexican interdisciplinary soprano vedette who fulfilled her music and theater studies in the National Conservatory of Music, the Theater Center of UNAM and in the Julliard Music School in New York. Among the prices she has earned are the acting scholarship Salvador Novo, the First Place in the Opera contest of Palm Beach, Florida, finalist in the singing contest of the Metropolitan Opera House in New York and one of the awards of Operalia II. She was nominated as best actress in the Film Festival of Venice for her performance in Profundo Carmesí, for which she also received an Ariel award in 1997. She has worked in different productions with the company Divas A.C., directed by Jesusa Rodríguez, among which are Donna Giovanni, Atracciones Fénix, Ambrosio o la Fábula del Mal Amor, and La Sumanita, where she acted as leading roles for a period of four years of tours in Europe and North America. In addition to her extensive credits as producer, writer, actress, singer and performer in diverse film, theater, cabaret, opera and world music projects, Regina Orozco is, since 1999, the director and producer of her theater company, Regina Orozco y Los Tigres de Sumatra (Regina Orozco and the Sumatran Tigers). Both an artist ad a political activist, Orozco is constantly supporting social causes campaigns as the empowerment of indigenous women, the protection of street children, gender equality and the rights of homosexuals.

=520  \\$a'To kill, or not to kill? That is the question.' This farcical cabaret performance, featuring Susana Zabaleta and Regina Orozco, poses the 'question' of violence in the context of current Mexican urban society. In a sort of film noir ambiance, the detective/cheerleader characters mix bel canto, circus music, marches, flamenco, rancheras, and pop ballads (musical score by Liliana Felipe) to connect the diverse skits on social violence. The tension between technology and nature (the cult of technology, here called the 'Faith of the Great Father, King Toshiba,' versus an esoteric, macrobiotic approach to natural forces), the relationship between the Church and the Army as violent power instances (with 'obscenity' as a common tool for the control and manipulation of society), the notion of public surveillance, as well as police brutality, government bureaucracy and political corruption are here juxtaposed to road violence, passion crimes, fashion 'rituals' and star/fan twisted relationships, testing and rethinking the limits of power, discipline and violence. Improvisation and the manipulation of diverse props (guns, masks, wigs) connect the music and the skits to the presence of the audience, aided by the onstage support of director Jesusa Rodríguez as prop assistant. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodréguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a chameleon, Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her espectáculos (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and carpa, to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguezs energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: I am going to die with that woman. Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. In this off-off space, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas, Jesusa y Liliana have produced hundreds of shows since the 1980s.

=520  \\$aThis documentary follows the work of Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani with Peru's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, created to investigate the violence which took place because of terrorism and political instability between 1980 and 2000 in Peru. On April 8, 2002 the TRC went to Huamanga for a first public hearing, followed by Huanta, Ayacucho three days after. Yuyachkani performed 'Adiós Ayacucho' (with Augusto Casafranca) and 'Rosa Cuchillo' (with Ana Correa); they also participated in public actions and vigils celebrated in public spaces to honor the 'disappeared'. The video shows townspeople speaking with members of Yuyachkani about their experiences with violence, interviews with Yuyachkani members about their experience performing and listening to the public, and footage of the performances and public testimonies. This is an excellent resource to understand Yuyachkanis relationship to their Peruvian audience -how their work has been influenced and driven by it. Perus most important theatre collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani (www.yuyachkani.org) has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. Yuyachkani is a Quechua word that means I am thinking, I am remembering; under this name, the theatre group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru. The group is comprised of seven actors (Augusto Casafranca, Amiel Cayo, Ana Correa, Débora Correa, Rebeca Ralli, Teresa Ralli, and Julián Vargas), a technical designer (Fidel Melquíades), and an artistic director (Miguel Rubio), who have made a commitment to collective creation as a mode of theatrical production and to group theatre as a life style. Their work has been among the most important in Latin Americas so called New Popular Theatre, with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy. Yuyachkani won Perus National Human Rights Award in 2000. Known for its creative embrace of both indigenous performance forms as well as cosmopolitan theatrical forms, Yuyachkani offers insight into Peruvian and Latin American theatre, and to broader issues of postcolonial social aesthetics.

In this performance, Yuyachkani is an exploration of Perus rich folkloric traditions, using animal masks and music, humor and a child-like concept of a farm animal cosmos to tell the parable about four aging domestic animals that run away and form a quartet rather than be put out to pasture or face the butcher's block. Based on Luis Enríquez & Sergio Bardottis Los Saltimbanquis and the Brothers Grimms classic fairy tale The Town Musicians of Bremen, the performance tells the story of the journey of four musician animals from four different regions of Peru: an Afro-Peruvian hen ('La Plumosa'), a donkey from the Southern plains ('El Burro'), a cat from the rainforest region ('La Michicha'), and a dog from the Northern coastal area ('El Chusco'). The animals abandon their hometowns in search of their dreams in the capital city; upon meeting each other along the way, and after many adventures and exploits, they decide to form a music group, the Músicos Ambulantes (Traveling Musicians), and to tour the country telling their multiethnic story. The resulting performance, by now a classic piece in Yuyachkanis repertoire (performed since 1983), is a popular musical theater celebration of Peruvian cultural and ethnic diversity. Perus most important theatre collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. Yuyachkani is a Quechua word that means I am thinking, I am remembering; under this name, the theatre group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru. The group is comprised of seven actors (Augusto Casafranca, Amiel Cayo, Ana Correa, Débora Correa, Rebeca Ralli, Teresa Ralli, and Julián Vargas), a technical designer (Fidel Melquíades), and an artistic director (Miguel Rubio), who have made a commitment to collective creation as a mode of theatrical production and to group theatre as a life style. Their work has been among the most important in Latin Americas so called New Popular Theatre, with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy. Yuyachkani won Perus National Human Rights Award in 2000. Known for its creative embrace of both indigenous performance forms as well as cosmopolitan theatrical forms, Yuyachkani offers insight into Peruvian and Latin American theatre, and to broader issues of postcolonial social aesthetics.

A performance about race and identity in the Americas, Anna Deavere Smith experiments with a translated performance, moving between English and Spanish to convey a series of portraits of representing identities in crisis. As an actor, playwright and teacher, Anna Deavere Smith has built a remarkably wide-ranging and respected career. Ms. Smith--whose work explores the American character and our multifaceted national identity--has been acclaimed by the media, critics and audiences across the country. The Macarthur Foundation awarded Ms. Smith a prestigious fellowship in 1996, saying she 'has created a new form of theater --a blend of theatrical art, social commentary, journalism and intimate reverie'. Looking at controversial events from multiple points of view, Ms. Smith's work combines the journalistic technique of interviewing her subjects with the art of interpreting their words through her performance. Ms. Smith founded and directed the Institute on the Arts & Civic Dialogue, a three-year experiment that was held for three summers (1998- 2000), at Harvard University. Ms. Smith is a tenured professor in the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University, with an additional affiliation at the New York University School of Law.

=520  \\$aInterview with Diana Taylor, founding director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, conducted by Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett. This interview is a part of a series curated by the Hemispheric Institute, articulated around the question 'What is Performance Studies?' The series aims to provide a multifaceted approach to the often difficult task of defining the coordinates of both a field of academic study as well as a lens through which to assess and document cultural practice and embodied behavior. The contingent definitions documented in this series are based on the groundbreaking experiences and the scholarly endeavors of renowned figures in contemporary performance studies and practice.

=520  \\$aThis video documents El Teatro Campesino's performance Mummified Deer. The play was inspired by a 1984 newspaper article describing an 86-year-old woman in Juarez, Mexico who was found to be carrying a 60-year-old mummified fetus in her womb. Fifteen years later, playwright, director and founder of ETC Luis Valdez returned to the article while simultaneously embarking on a highly personal investigation of his own family history. Valdez traveled to Sonora, Mexico to investigate his family's Yaqui roots and ancestral history; Mummified Deer derived from his time in Mexico and the newspaper article, in what Valdez considers to be his most personal play to date. Armida, Valdezs mother, is re-envisioned as a young woman by the same name; his grandmothers, aunts and cousins fused into the other leading characters. The main action of the play takes place in 1999 by the side of Mama Chus hospital bed, but also flashes back to 1969 when the Chicano Movement was just starting, back through the thirties and twenties, to the turn of the 20th Century and the Mexican Revolution when Mama Chu crosses the border into the United States. The genocidal war against the Yaquis in Mexico, forcing Mama Chu to migrate to the US, is only one of the familys buried secrets. In spite of the fluidity of time zones, what anchors all the action is the constant presence of a young Yaqui deer dancer who dances but does not speak, symbolizing the 60-year-old mummified fetus. The play incorporates themes of family conflict within the broader context of history and social struggle. Staged two years after the original production at the San Diego Repertory Theater, this version of Mummified Deer contains several changes and refinements to the script.

=520  \\$aSince 1981, the Split Britches Company (founded by Lois Weaver, Peggy Shaw, and Deb Margolin, www.splitbritches.com) has written and performed in trio, duet, and solo, as well as collaborated and performed with other artists. They describe their work in this way: 'Our work is rooted in popular culture, but positioned against it. It relies on moments rather than plot, relationships rather than story. It depends on the surprise of transformation rather than the logic of psychological narrative. It straddles the line between performance and theater, exploiting theatricality while exposing the pretense. It is about a community of outsiders, queers, eccentrics. It is feminist because it encourages the imaginative potential in everyone and lesbian because it takes the presence of lesbian on stage as a given.' Their vaudevillian satirical gender-bending performances have received numerous awards, including a Jane Chamber award and four Village Voice OBIE awards. Their collection of scripts, 'Split Britches Feminist Performance/Lesbian Practice', edited by Sue Ellen Case, won the 1997 Lambda Literary Award for Drama. These two videos document the NY premieres of the shows 'Miss Risqué' and 'It's A Small House and We've Lived in It Always', performed at La Mama, in the context of the two-piece spectacle show 'Double Agency', the first collaboration between Split Britches and the renowned English troupe The Clod Ensemble. The first video in this set documents their piece 'Miss Risqué', a story of secrets and showgirls, set in turn-of-the-century Paris, where working-class girls could become rich and famous, prostitutes could pass for nobility, women could have open affairs with women, and sex wasn't exclusive to the marital bed. A piece on 'resistant femininity', 'Miss Risqué' is a lyrical lesbian tarantella that explores the power of femininity, visibility, invisibility and deception. It was commissioned by the Nuffield Theatre, Lancaster University and supported by the National Lottery through the Arts Council of England, the London Arts Board, and Queen Mary, University of London. The second video in this set documents their piece Its a Small House and We've Lived in it Always. In it, two explorers lay claim to the same territory. With three chairs as its only props, little speech, some song and much meaningful movement and expressive acting, the piece shows longtime cohabitants engaged in a contest for space. These people have known each other for a long time. They occupy a house the size of a small stage, a house divided and subdivided by time and bad habits. They sit on the porch, watch the horizon, and wait for the weather to change. Their only hope is an audience. As they move apart and then together, spurn advances and accept closeness, mime rejection and flirtation and reveal need, the two performers enact the ebb and flow of a universally resonant relationship. This work was first commissioned by the South Bank Center as part of the British Festival of Visual Theatre.

=520  \\$aFrom 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a ‘new world’ - one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting demographics. From a geographic ‘outpost’ in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, methods, and production. One of New WORLD Theater’s artistic legacies is Project 2050, a multi-year youth arts initiative built on the demographic projection that people of color would become the majority in the United States by 2050. The program brought together professional artists, youth communities from Massachusetts, scholars, and community activists to engage civic dialogue and create original performances based on themes that addressed young performers’ dreams and concerns. Performances were created from workshops that included playwriting, poetry, breakdancing, drumming, beatboxing, lyricism, singing, songwriting, stepping, and visual art.
=520  \\$aThis is a collage of video clips that feature excerpts of performances by artists who collaborated with New WORLD Theater, thus showing the scope and diversity of the entire project. The clips feature pieces of performances by Project 2050, Everett Dance Theatre, Rennie Harris Puremovement, and UNIVERSES. Project 2050’s ‘Ashy Ankles’ explores oppressive statements around race and gender that the performers have experienced as young women of color. Everette Dance Theatre’s piece interweaves spoken dialogue and movement, thus underlining the meaningful roles of voice and body in performance. Rennie Harris Puremovement explores gender and race violence, and the struggles tied to identity politics. Finally, UNIVERSES performs a song that invites to reflect upon race and ethnicity as both a mark of identity and an impulse to create a better future.

=511  1\$aHeidi Abderhalden Cortés.
=520  \\$aMapa Teatro's piece '4.48 Psicosis,' based on Sarah Kane's posthumous play, references that time at dawn where psychotic crisis episodes present themselves. The text is not a product of depression but a dramatic poem where words are decanted by disillusionment, a solo symphony at 4:48 am, the happy hour when clarity pays a visit. In this production, the voice - along with music and fragmented images - is configured in space as a poetic sound installation. Three voices are present: that of a fragmented mind, that of a woman in love with absence, and the soft psychiatric voice of reason. The resulting performance is not a representation or a description of Kane's texts, but a series of photograms portraying the journey of a woman pierced by visions of a dehumanized world. One of the foremost artistic companies in Colombia, Mapa Teatro (www.mapateatro.org) has been producing theater, performance and art installation projects since 1984. Founders and directors, Rolf and Heidi Abderhalden have created a wide ranging repertoire of theater, opera, mixed-media performance, and site-specific installation. Their work proposes richly textured visual metaphors in which they consider often complex psychological, social and political relationships. Committed to experimentation, and less interested in the actor as an 'agent of fiction,' they describe their project as 'a laboratory of social imagination,' that offers a space for presenting community issues and human concerns in media and performance. This combination of real-life situations and sites along with highly stylized aesthetic staging produces a tension between real action and (re)presentation. Mapa Teatro draws from live events captured on video such as the demolition of a neighborhood in Bogotá, ritual practice, and texts that explore the relationship of postmodern subjects, myth and metaphor. Mapa Teatro has performed by commissions, festivals and collaborative projects world-wide.

=520  \\$aThis is a video documentation of Mapa Teatro’s artistic creation laboratory, with the participation of a group of former inhabitants of the neighborhood of Santa Inés del Cartucho, between 2002 and 2003. The laboratory’s goal was to stage the first act of ‘Prometheus,’ by Heiner Müller (1929-1995), to be performed in the vacant land left after the demolition of El Cartucho. This neighborhood was erased during the gentrification process promoted by the Peñalosa’s administration in 1990. This documentary shows the stories and memories of the people evicted from their space: how they got there, how their lives were there, how their affects and bodies were part of El Cartucho. Both these stories and archive images from the gentrification’s years, allow an approximation to the diverse experiences of reality before, during, and after the demolition and extermination of this historical space.

=520  \\$aThis is a video documentation of the staging of ‘Prometheus,’ performed by the participants of the artistic creation laboratory lead by Mapa Teatro in collaboration with former inhabitants of the neighborhood Santa Inés del Cartucho, demolished during the gentrification process of Bogota’s historic downtown. The minimal objects rescued from this erased space, such as chairs, tables, and beds, are in contrast with the open space of the illuminated city – an ironic horizon for stories of loss and displacement. Both through archive images and video, the inhabitants of El Cartucho tell their stories, individually and collectively, and the spectators can get a glimpse of memories that remain after being removed from a space of belonging. The video documentation of this performance suggests the many layers involved in the process of remembering and forgetting: the bodies of these Colombian citizens perform in a space that is not there anymore, neither for them nor for us. In the same way that their presence in a ghostly space activate living memories, Mapa Teatro’s documentation project is an invitation to engage with the ongoing process of enacting memory, and to question the guidelines imposed in the name of a progress that intends to erase whatever it considers ‘unacceptable.’

=520  \\$aA chance encounter occurs between an aspiring club DJ, his agent, her ex-boyfriend, and a bike messenger and no one is ever the same. Through a blend of culture, sexuality and music the entrance of the mysterious stranger forces the romantic triad to face each other and themselves in Greg Beuthin’s Rewind (A Soundtrack for Longing). What begins as an ordinary day with ordinary people becomes a poignant look at war, culture, and love. This staged reading was presented as part of the NYC Hip-Hop Theater Festival.

=520  \\$a'El Fulgor Argentino, Club Social y Deportivo' brings together a hundred performers, an orchestra and big puppets in order to perform a hundred years of Argentine history (1930-2030) as seen through the social dances of a community club. El Fulgor Argentino social club opens its doors as a dance hall in 1930. The military coup that brings down the presidency of Hipólito Yrigoyen interrupts the party. From then on, the dance hall activities reflect the ups and downs in Argentinean history. Political confrontations and military coups cut short El Fulgor's dance party, a celebration permanently struggling to be resumed. Rhythms change, fashion trends change, the dance is interrupted and reopened, to the beat of history's ebbs and flows. This piece is, in Catalinas Sur's own words, an exploration of memory, not as a scientific or academic approach to historical events, but as an artistic attempt to recover and recreate milestones of the community's collective memory. The idea of Grupo de Teatro Catalinas Sur (www.catalinasur.com.ar) came to life during a neighborhood barbeque held by a school's parents association in 1983. It was during the time of Argentina's military dictatorship, which stifled popular expression, and the theater group used its community service as a form of resistance that strengthened feelings of solidarity and mutual binding. The group remains rooted in its Buenos Aires neighborhood, even as its membership and fame has grown, performing in a converted warehouse. Catalinas Sur members are acknowledged followers of the traditional artistic forms performed in the quarter which has been the birthplace of the popular arts: puppeteers, musicians, actors, artists originating from the old continent or from Latin America and who mingled their art, like a crucible, with the neighborhood. Firm believers that society can be changed by teamwork and a sense of community, Catalinas Sur has created more than 20 plays and, sweeping aside all false generation gaps, has now over 300 actors. In their own words, 'with the advent of this globalized and inhumane millennium, we are attempting, through the theater, to remember the value of our individual and collective histories, and revive the memory that believed and believes in a better world.'

=520  \\$aThe play tells the story of a 'barrio de invasión' (a neighborhood of internal refugees that 'invaded' an empty lot) in the suburbs of Cali. These neighborhoods are built from scratch by displaced people escaping from violence and poverty in other regions of Colombia. After building their homes, the refugees have to fight against the attempts at violent relocation by the state and the police. The neighborhood in the play is located by a stream between two hills. The stream is often blood-colored as a result of fights between the inhabitants of the opposing hills, a rivalry that evokes the feud between the Montagues and the Capulets in 'Romeo and Juliet'. The characters are mainly young gangsters and their girlfriends. Through break-dancing and rapping, love finds its way among everyday violence in this symbolic portrait of Colombian society. Teatro Experimental de Cali (TEC) is a collective of artists committed to the exploration and creation of new languages for Latin American theater. Founded in Colombia in 1955 by Enrique Buenaventura and a group of students at the Instituto Departamental de Bellas Artes, TEC has had a long and fruitful trajectory; their artistic and theoretical work has revolutionized the way that theater is conceived and practiced in Latin America. A key contribution to the field is their method of 'creación colectiva' ('collective creation'), in which all the participants of the play - including the audience - become involved with the dramatic text and its staging. In spite of this stress on collective work, TEC had in Enrique Buenaventura its main poet and playwright, who developed most of TEC's texts and directed the majority of their plays. While TEC's works address various historical and social issues, artistic quality is not sacrificed for the sake of political radicalism. TEC has thus created a theater that is politically and culturally engaged, poetic and innovative without losing its popular appeal.

=520  \\$aThis play deals with Colombian political violence through the metaphor of 'social cleansing', a process that has tainted the country with blood. The paramilitary forces and the guerrillas tend to 'get rid' of individuals they mark as 'filth': drug addicts, homeless people, prostitutes, and so on. The play suggests that this political process rests on the border that divides folly from crime, a border that is constantly permeated by bullets and shots. Virgilio, the main character, thinks he has the right to perform the 'cleansing', to execute 'justice', to erect his own court of law.A serial killer, he has developed an obsession with young and beautiful women (of which he is jealous). He has a 'shadow', who follows him and contemplates each of his crimes, torn between morbid pleasure and a weak desire to stop him. Teatro Experimental de Cali (TEC) is a collective of artists committed to the exploration and creation of new languages for Latin American theater. Founded in Colombia in 1955 by Enrique Buenaventura and a group of students at the Instituto Departamental de Bellas Artes, TEC has had a long and fruitful trajectory; their artistic and theoretical work has revolutionized the way that theater is conceived and practiced in Latin America. A key contribution to the field is their method of 'creación colectiva' ('collective creation'), in which all the participants of the play - including the audience - become involved with the dramatic text and its staging.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of Nao Bustamante's solo performance 'Sans Gravity', presented as a part of the 4th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, celebrated in July of 2003 in New York City, United States under the title 'Spectacles of Religiosities'. Water can symbolize many things, but often it is associated with knowledge and emotion; both of which are difficult to define in logical terms. In the installation/performance space of 'Sans Gravity', Bustamante explores the metaphors associated with water in the physical realm by burdening her body. The weight and the movement of the water develop into extensions of the gesture and another layer of the distorted self. The audience becomes a mechanism of relief. Nao Bustamante is an internationally known performance art pioneer originating from the San Joaquin Valley of California. Her work encompasses performance art, installation, video, pop music and experimental rips in time. Using the body as a source of image, narrative and emotion, her performances communicate on the level of subconscious language taking the spectator on a bizarre journey, with haunting images, cracking stereotypes by embodying them. Bustamante's work has been presented, among other sites at, the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Arts, and the Kiasma Museum of Helsinki. She has performed in Galleries, Museums, Universities and underground sites throughout Asia, Africa, Europe, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Mexico and the United States. Her collaborations include working with such luminaries as 'Coco Fusco' and 'Osseus Labrint'. In 2001 she received the prestigious Anonymous Was a Woman fellowship. Currently she is living in Troy, New York and an assistant professor of New Media and Live Art at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

=520  \\$aPerformance/ installation developed by Colombian theater ensemble Teatro La Máscara around the theme of 'water wars', exploring issues around conservation, environmental aspects, contamination, consumption, waste, and resource management of water. Staged in an empty house in the San Antonio neighborhood in Cali, Colombia, and based on a concept by Jill Greenhalgh, La Máscara reflects on the scarcity of water; the scenes - 'Marimba', 'Deshielo', 'Gotas de Vida', 'Sed', 'Reflejos del Alma', 'H2O', 'Evaporazul' - explore related topics like dehydration, ice melting, drought, pollution, conservation, etc. Objects, bodies, and a voice-over with statistical data are combined in poetic ways to remind the audience of the interconnectedness of natural resources and social life, rendering these issues close to home, impossible to dismiss, requiring to be urgently acknowledged and addressed. Teatro La Máscara is the oldest - and one of the only - feminist, all-women's theater in Colombia. Founded in 1972 in Cali, La Máscara was a political theater initially comprised of male and female actors; by the early 1980s, when only the women stayed and wanted to continue the theatrical trajectory of the group, Lucy Bolaños decided to make La Máscara a women's ensemble fully dedicated to a feminine dramaturgy on gender issues. Committed to feminism and social change, they have stayed true to this mission, despite the many social and economic pressures they've had to endure in an environment plagued by violence and machismo, which constantly seeks to 'invisibilize' their work. Because of their fruitful stubbornness, La Máscara is not only creating and staging plays, but also working with marginalized communities, actively participating in political protests and demonstrations, and being involved in the organization of theater festivals. Through their work, they keep re-thinking women's role in the construction of a peaceful Colombia.

=520  \\$aJavier Cardona is a Puerto Rican dancer/actor and pedagogue. Trained on Puerto Rico within the graphic-dramatic experimental Project Los Teatreros Ambulantes de Cayey of the University of Puerto Rico under the artistic direction of pedagogues/artists Rosa Luisa Márquez and Antonio Martorell, Javier has also worked and trained with renowned international theater artists like Miguel Rubio (Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani, Peru), Osvaldo Dragún (Argentina, EITALC), Augusto Boal (Theater of the Oppressed, Brazil), and Peter Schumman (Bread and Puppet Theater, United States). Through his experiences in theater, Javier explores experimental dance, training with Gloria Llompart and Viveca Vázquez in Puerto Rico, as well as dancing with choreographers Sally Silvers and Jennifer Monson in New York City. He has worked in community-based theater educational programs, and is a member of the Taller de Otra Cosa, a collaborative cultural organization that promotes artistic educational programs in communities and the development of experimental performing arts events. As a choreographer and director, Javier explores issues of gender and race, rooted in his experiences as an Afro Puerto Rican queer artist working in Caribbean, Latin American and American societies. His one-person dance/theater performance 'You Dont Look Like...', created in 1996, deals with themes of race and identity in Puerto Rico, paying special attention to racial stereotypes pervasive in popular culture and the entertainment industries. Issues of violence, discrimination and racism experienced by Afro Caribbeans are dealt with through the exploration of the relationship between bodies and politics of representation, here performed through experimental juxtapositions of photographs, dance, anecdotes, and direct interaction with the audience.

=520  \\$aSusana Cook (www.susanacook.com) is a New York-based Argentinean theater and performance artist. Mainly directed to queer and Latino communities in New York City, Cook's work also encompasses a heated response to broader State policies that oppress communities defined in the intersection of race, gender, and class. In her shows, Cook parodies discourses of power, drawing attention to the close ties between the state, religious and political conservatism, and the military. Cook's plays usually feature all-women casts that defy the normative performance of gender, race, and sexuality. 'Dykenstein' is a lesbian adaptation of the classic story of 'Frankenstein.' In this play, Dr. Dykenstein triumphantly creates 'the perfect dyke,' but one of her assistants carelessly leaves the creature unattended in front of a TV and a bunch of trashy magazines. Brainwashed by mainstream media, the perfect dyke becomes a 'wild' straight woman. Desperate for a husband, the monster threatens to murder Dr. Dykenstein if he does not make one for her. 'Dykenstein' is a parody of the Christian Right's take on science, the U.S. anti-abortion crusade (which declared that having aborting a fetus older than two weeks is murdering an American citizen), and the rights of women.

Cook's plays usually feature all-women casts that defy the normative performance of gender, race, and sexuality. 'Homerun' is a monologue about God and homeruns that Susana Cook performs playing a guitar. The solo piece was inspired by a commentary by a famous baseball player that Susana saw on TV, in which the player presented homeruns as 'a God-giving thing.' In the monologue, Susana humorously locates this 'gift' in inadequate contexts like Argentina, where baseball is not a popular sport like in the United States; and she also imagines a female protagonist who, despite her talent, would not make it to the major league because of her gender. 'Homerun' was part of 'Rivers of Honey, Women's of Color Cabaret,' held at WOW Theatre Café in New York City.

=520  \\$aTo understand the soul of the 'sertanejo' (the inhabitant of the sertão) - what would lead the nature of this man to resist until the last day in Canudos - Euclides da Cunha recalls in his book the formation of Brazilian society, its telluric, animal, and tupi origin. The second part of the book (and the second play, O Homem I), is about the vigorous embrace of the winner, the Celtic European Colonizer, copulating with the defeated, with the slaves from the ships, forming the 'Typeless-Brazilian' type. Mixtures of all kinds find their space in the stage in the surprising miscegenation already present in the cast and crew of Teatro Oficina itself. It is the story of the Brazilian Man, the Man of the Country abroad interbreeding with the Country inside, until the Revolt against the very idea - imposed and imported - of man, with the appearance of Zarathustra Antônio Conselheiro.
=520  \\$aFrom 2000 to 2007, Teat(r)o Oficina Uzyna Uzona worked on the staging of Euclides da Cunha's epic book, Os Sertões, which describes the 19th Century War of Canudos in the Brazilian 'sertão,' lead by Antônio Conselheiro. The final result was a pentalogy, formed by the plays A Terra (2002), O Homem I (2003), O Homem II (2003), A Luta I (2005), and A Luta II (2006), totalizing 27 hours of theater. Os Sertões reads the episodes of the war in light of past and present Brazilian history, and in relation to the struggle of the group against media mogul Sílvio Santos, who wanted to tear down the historic theater.

=520  \\$aDedicated to 'the creation of an heroic and anti-heroic attitude of those that go to war and say: Farewell Man!,' the theatrical version of the second movement of the second part of Os Sertões presents the passage from the re-volted man to the trans-man, creator of an alternate possibility for human adventure on Earth. From the story of Antônio Conselheiro, all theater relives its seminal death: a common man who, out of love, transmutes into an anti-messianic leader, gathering a legion of 'sertanejos,' roots of solidarity in the inlands of Bahia who, in a community effort, raise dams, churchs, and cemetaries. The community had at one point 25 thousand inhabitants, in its days the second largest city of Bahia. Capuchin Friars attempted to disperse the people of Canudos 'diplomatically.' Their denial to obey the official religious order led the Evangelist Friar to damn the followers of Antônio Conselheiro in the name of Jesus. The City prepares for war.

=520  \\$aRolf and Heidi Abderhalden of Mapa Teatro direct the Ópera de Colombia in the 'The Magic Flute' by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Mapa Teatro's rendition of the classic singspiel explores the magic nature of its plot, placing the piece at the crossroads of fantasy, comedy and philosophy - the realm of dreams, that mysterious zone of humanity. In this surreal performance (where fantastic masks, multimedia projections, surreal costumes and magnificent opera singing coexist) faces are almost imperceptible, gestures are almost intangible, psyche becomes voice, voice becomes body, body becomes space, space becomes time, and characters are constantly transfigured and transformed. One of the foremost artistic companies in Colombia, Mapa Teatro (www.mapateatro.org) has been producing theater, performance and art installation projects since 1984. Founders and directors, Rolf and Heidi Abderhalden have created a wide ranging repertoire of theater, opera, mixed-media performance, and site-specific installation. Their work proposes richly textured visual metaphors in which they consider often complex psychological, social and political relationships. Committed to experimentation, and less interested in the actor as an 'agent of fiction,' they describe their project as 'a laboratory of social imagination,' that offers a space for presenting community issues and human concerns in media and performance. This combination of real-life situations and sites along with highly stylized aesthetic staging produces a tension between real action and (re)presentation. Mapa Teatro draws from live events captured on video such as the demolition of a neighborhood in Bogotá, ritual practice, and texts that explore the relationship of postmodern subjects, myth and metaphor. Mapa Teatro has performed by commissions, festivals and collaborative projects world-wide.

=520  \\$aA poetic look at the violence - both external and internal - wreaking havoc in the lives of black men, In the Last Car is one man’s story whose implications reach far beyond his life. From everyday encounters to relationship struggles, from substance abuse to subway rides, protagonist Agaceez’s lyrical exploration is poignant as he is kidnapped by some very dark characters, and manages to discover his purpose. The play is an intimate glance at the struggles taking place in the last car, and other places that too often go overlooked.

The protagonist is a woman named Domitila whose husband, a drinker and a lecher, complains that she never wants to have sex; instead, she directs her erotic longings toward the divine: a luminous angel who appears in her dreams, and the santitos or small statues of saints to whom she prays. The Demon’s Nun offers a humorous view of very serious issues—violence against women, limited educational opportunities, alcoholism, and abuse by priests.
=520  \\$aPetrona de la Cruz and Isabel Juárez Espinosa are Mayan Indian playwrights and actresses from Chiapas, Mexico. Pioneers in theatre and social justice in their country, in 1994 they formed the women’s cooperative FOMMA, to empower displaced Indian women and children through workshops in bilingual education (Tzotzil/Tzeltal and Spanish) health programs, job skills and theatre. They have performed in small communities throughout Chiapas as well as at universities and festivals abroad. Forced to leave their native villages at an early age, they became maids in the neighboring mestizo city of San Cristóbal de las Casas. In the 1980s they went to work at the fledging Indian writers' cooperative, Sna Jtz'bajom. It was there they became interested in theatre and received training from Ralph Lee of the Metawee River Theatre Company. They have subsequently worked with several other teachers including Amy Trompetter and Luis de Tavira.

Everywhere secularism is in retreat. Not only are fundamentalists on the rise but also many competing brands of spirituality are now widely disseminated through media, film, best selling fiction and television. While most orthodox religions have always used ritual and performance, telecommunications and televisual effects are transforming religion into religiosity. The return of religion has become an issue. Jean Franco is currently Professor Emeritus at Columbia University. She is the winner of the PEN 1996 award for lifetime contribution to the dissemination of Latin American literature in English and has been recognized by the Chilean and Venezuelan governments for advanced scholarship on Latin American literature in the United States.

=520  \\$aThe play poses a critique on the Colombian ruling class in all its miseries and contradictions. The piece is comprised of a series of skits. Some of the characters are: an upper class couple, an old dying aristocrat, an old and lonely lady, and an 18-year-old nerd socialite at her birthday. Corruption, violence, superficiality, materialism ands pettiness are some of the traits explored in the piece. La Candelaria was founded in 1966 by a group of independent artists and intellectuals who came from experimental theater and the broader Colombian cultural movement. Directed by Santiago García, La Candelaria (www.teatrolacandelaria.org.co) is one of Colombian theater's most innovative agents, modernizing national drama while addressing popular audiences. By means of an ongoing exploration of national folklore, situations and characters, they have created some of Colombia's most compelling plays, some of them through the method of 'creación colectiva' ('collective creation'), addressing the acute social and political problems of their society. At the same time, they fostered the creation of Corporación Colombiana del Teatro and have developed a number of theoretical works that reflect upon dramatic creation, its methods and languages. Still nowadays, La Candelaria is committed to repertoire, experimentation, and discussion as fundamental elements to artistic creation.

=520  \\$aUnedited documentation of a Pocha Nostra interactive performance in the Museo del Chopo, Mexico City. After an intensive workshop with 15 local performance/visual artists, curators, DJ's and musicians, the troupe performs an 'experimental curiosity cabinet', a sort of living museum where participants exhibit constructed 'hybrid personas' based on their own complex identities and personal sense of race and gender. These 'cultural especimens' compose a diorama of fetishized identities, addressing issues of appropriation of hybridity by corporate multiculturalism. La Pocha Nostra (www.pochanostra.com) is an ever-morphing trans-disciplinary arts organization, founded in 1993 by Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Roberto Sifuentes, and Nola Mariano in California. The objective was to formally conceptualize Gómez-Peña's collaborations with other performance artists. It provides a base (and forum) for a loose network of rebel artists from various disciplines, generations and ethnic backgrounds, whose common denominator is the desire to cross and erase dangerous borders between art and politics, practice and theory, artist and spectator. As of June 2006, members include performance artists Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Violeta Luna, Michelle Ceballos, and Roberto Sifuentes; curators Gabriela Salgado and Orlando Britto; and over thirty associates worldwide in countries such as Mexico, Spain, the UK, and Australia. Projects range from performance solos and duets to large-scale performance installations including video, photography, audio, and cyber-art. La Pocha collaborates across national borders, race, gender and generations. Their collaborative model functions both as an act of citizen diplomacy and as a means to create ephemeral communities of like-minded rebels. The basic premise of these collaborations is founded on an ideal: If we learn to cross borders on stage, we may learn how to do so in larger social spheres. La Pocha strives to eradicate myths of purity and dissolve borders surrounding culture, ethnicity, gender, language, and métier. These are radical acts.

In 1986 she founded the Magdalena Project International Network of Women in Contemporary Theater and has remained its artistic director. Her current performance projects include The Water[war]s a long term investigation in collaboration with different groups of women performers across the globe and Las Sin Tierra - & attempted crossings of the Straits of Gibraltar which she directed for Nomad Theater of Spain, in collaboration with the artist and designer Mike Brookes. Currently, she is lecturer in Performance Studies at the University of Wales Aberystwyth. Mike Brookes began his career as a painter and has increasingly reconnected his work with performance. In recent years his work has focused largely upon the holistic production of durational objects, environments, and contexts, in which short-range and satellite radio broadcast technology, mobile telecommunications, helicopters, cars, trains, surveillance camera and monitoring equipment.

=520  \\$aIn this video documentation of ‘Faxes a Rumberta,’ Astrid Hadad brings the female body at the center of the stage. Through her songs and her comments, she discusses issues such as gender identities, political authoritarianism, religious dogmatism, feudalistic systems, and female submission and male machismo. Hadad’s performance follows a narrative through the story of Rumberta, who starts as an innocent provincial woman who breaks with the patriarchal traditions and travels alone to Mexico City, where finally she decides to live her life in her own terms. It is specially compelling the alternation and juxtaposition of contradictory discourses on her body and her voice, given that she enacts both male and female characters. At the end, her famous mustache is a prop that suggests that gender is nothing but a construction.
=520  \\$aAstrid Hadad is a vocalist and performance artist from Mexico. Her work as a solo performance artist took off in 1995 with her show ‘Heavy Nopal.’ The term ‘heavy nopal’ refers to the Mexican cactus distilled to make tequila and is how Hadad describes her style of performance. Her shows follow the format of a cabaret, in which Hadad dazzles her audience with stunning vocals and elaborated costumes. She appropriates iconic images in Mexican culture, straps them to her body, and walks onstage to reconfigure their meanings. Through her voice and her body, Hadad challenges to her audience to adopt her system of cultural processing. Most of her work challenges cultural norms pertaining to gender roles in Mexican society. She also addresses issues of US neo imperialism. Hadad writes, produces, and promotes her own work.

=520  \\$a'Baba Yaga' is the result of a nine-month laboratory in mask work and puppetry directed by Deborah Hunt in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico, in which the participants created their masks and puppets and collectively worked on the production. 'Baba Yaga' is an early and way more interesting version of Cinderella, with the heroine emerging as a strong and powerful being. Hunt presents these long workshops every two years ... from these experiences have emerged companies of younger 'mascareros' (maskmakers) who have developed their own style and focus. Deborah Hunt is a maskmaker, puppeteer and performance artist with 35 years experience in the creation and presentation of original theater and performance works. She has worked in New Zealand, USA, England, Mexico, Central America, Puerto Rico, British Windward Islands, Argentina, Denmark, Norway, Belgrade, Venezuela, Cuba, Spain, Singapore, Australia, and has been working bilingually (English/Spanish) since 1985. Hunt also teaches puppetry and maskwork, offering intensive laboratories lasting from a weekend to nine-months long. Born in New Zealand, residing in Puerto Rico since 1990, she is a member of the Magdalena Project and the Founder and Artistic Director of MASKHUNT Inc, theater of the futile.

=520  \\$aFulana's 'Lupe & JuanDi from the Block' is a mock music video that explores two main themes: the hyper-commercialization of religious icons, and the 'whitening' of Latinos when they cross over into mainstream pop culture. Fulana used The Virgin of Guadalupe to comment on the commodification of religion, as her image is everywhere: on t-shirts, postcards, key chains, handbags, designer jeans, etc.; she has become a hipster-friendly Latina Virgin superstar. Juan Diego, the indigenous man to whom this Virgin first appeared, has recently made it to sainthood, but he has been 'whitened' in the Vatican's official image, which erases his indigenous traits and makes him look like a Spaniard. This is reminiscent of the whitening of Latina/o pop stars when they 'make it' in the music industry ( e.g. Shakira). Rewriting J-Lo's pop hit, 'Jenny from the Block,' this video stages the 'creation' of Saint Juan Diego by mafia-sounding Vatican intelligence (the Pope and music producer Emilio Estefan). Knowing the Catholic Church is in crisis, losing many of their flock to Evangelicals, they decide to canonize Juan Diego to attract the Latino market. Mr. Estefan gives Juan Diego a 'cross-over make-over' and the Pope canonizes him on the spot. JuanDi is thrilled by his transformation, but the Virgin admonishes him for having sold out. As the song progresses, their fighting becomes more intense, their egos take over, and they eventually alienate their supporters, who go off with an Evangelical couple who knocks at their door. Fulana (www.fulana.org) is a Latina video collective from New York City. Through parody and satire, Fulana explores themes that are relevant to Latino cultures in the U.S., delving into the nuances that bind our experiences, experimenting with strategies to make visible what we're so often made to read between the lines. Their work, which consists mainly of mock television commercials, music videos and print advertisements, responds to the ways products and ideas are marketed to Latinos through the mass media.

=520  \\$aMapa Teatro's installation project, 'Re-corridos,' memorializes the demolition of an urban neighborhood known as Santa Inés-El Cartucho in Bogotá, Colombia. Staged in a rustic, colonial home typical of the neighborhood, the installation was visited by more than 6,000 spectators during the last phase of demolition in the first half of December 2003. Based on testimony of former inhabitants, Mapa Teatro attempts to reconstruct traces of life in found objects, photographs, sound and audio-visual display as a refuge for these fragments of memory. The installation consists of 12 physical spaces that correspond to niches of memory of El Cartucho: 'El Testigo' (object); 'El campanero' (interactive sound); 'El escombro' (video sound installation); 'Los pasos' (photographic projection); 'El Carro / La báscula' (interactive installation); 'La botella' (interactive object); 'La casa' (video projection); 'La habitación' (video-sound installation); 'La piel' (sound installation); 'El fósforo' (photo installation); 'El resto' (installation); 'La voz' (sound installation). One of the foremost artistic companies in Colombia, Mapa Teatro (www.mapateatro.org) has been producing theater, performance and art installation projects since 1984. Founders and directors, Rolf and Heidi Abderhalden have created a wide ranging repertoire of theater, opera, mixed-media performance, and site-specific installation. Their work proposes richly textured visual metaphors in which they consider often complex psychological, social and political relationships. Committed to experimentation, and less interested in the actor as an 'agent of fiction,' they describe their project as 'a laboratory of social imagination,' that offers a space for presenting community issues and human concerns in media and performance. This combination of real-life situations and sites along with highly stylized aesthetic staging produces a tension between real action and (re)presentation. Mapa Teatro draws from live events captured on video such as the demolition of a neighborhood in Bogotá, ritual practice, and texts that explore the relationship of postmodern subjects, myth and metaphor. Mapa Teatro has performed by commissions, festivals and collaborative projects world-wide.

Border Sound Files is an hour long solo performance-lecture that mixes spoken narrative, spoken, history, and spoken critique, with a collage of sound, noise, and music. The piece focuses on the border between Southern California and Northern Mexico and explores it as a transnational field of sound, an aural border. Josh Kun is Associate Professor of English at University of Southern Californias Annenberg School for Communication, and he contributes on a regular basis to the Los Angeles Times, the New York Times, Los Angeles Magazine, the Village Voice, the San Francisco Bay Guardian and the Boston Phoenix. He is a 2000-2002 Sundance Writers Fellow whose writing has appeared in the popular press, scholarly journals, and book anthologies. He is the host of two Latin music video and culture shows (The Red Zone on MTV-Español and Rokamole on KJLA) and is a resident DJ with the US-UK-Latin America nightclub La Leche. He is the author of Audiotopia: Music, Race, and America (UC Press) which won a 2006 American Book Award.

=520  \\$aRosa Luisa Márquez (www.marquezmartorell.org) is a Puerto Rican theater artist and pedagogue. Founding member of the theater group Anamú in 1971, she holds a Master's degree from New York University and a Doctorate from Michigan State University; she specializes in contemporary theater. Rosa Luisa started her teaching career at the Theater department of the University of Puerto Rico in 1978. She developed the current curriculum of Drama Activities, which she teaches in her workshops at schools, prisons, rehab centers, women's shelters, nursing homes and community centers. Her directing projects include 'Romeo(s) y Julieta(s),' 'Historias para ser Contadas,' 'La Leyenda del Cemí,' 'Procesión,' 'Waiting for Godot,' 'Jardín de Pulpos,' 'Absurdos en Soledad,' 'El León y la Joya,' among others. In conjunction with Puerto Rican visual artist Antonio Martorell, she created the concept of Itinerant Performers (1987-1990) resulting in twelve productions. Published books include 'Brincos y saltos: el juego como disciplina teatral' and 'Historias para ser contadas, montaje de Rosa Luisa Márquez.' She is a member of the board of directors and pedagogical team for the EITALC's International School of Latin American and Caribbean Theater. Ongoing artistic collaborators include Gilda Navarra and Antonio Martorell (Puerto Rico), Grupo Malayerba (Ecuador), Grupo Yuyachkani (Peru), and directors Peter Shumann (Bread & Puppet Theater, U.S.A.) and Augusto Boal (Theater of the Oppressed, Brazil). This video documents the theater piece 'Romeo(s) y Julieta(s),' created collaboratively by Márquez with her students of the course of Experimental Theater at the University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras campus. Based on Pablo Neruda's version of the classic Shakespearean tragedy, the play crystallizes a year-long investigation on the creative links between theater and visual arts, in homage to renowned Puerto Rican scenographer José 'Checo' Cuevas. Antonio Martorell collaborated with this elaborated version of 'Romeo and Juliet,' where the classic feud between Montagues and Capulets echoes the current political climate of colonialism, warfare, and 'an eye for an eye' political mentality affecting American foreign affairs, with concrete resonances with the Iraq War as well as with social and political violence at play in Puerto Rico.

Africa prints her marks, traces and styles on the American territories, inscribing herself on the palimpsests that, by means of countless processes of cognition, assertion and metamorphosis, both conceptual and formal, transcreate and perform her presence and heritage. The arts and cultural creations colored by the African knowledge ostensibly reveal the ingenious and arduous means of survival of the African memory transplanted to the Americas by the diasporic Atlantic slave-trade and by other transcultural and transnational routes. Introduction by Zeca Ligiero. Leda Martins is Professor of Literature, Arts and Sciences at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais. A major theorist of Afro-Brazilian religious performance, she has done extensive work on 'congados' and other forms of diasporic worship that participate in the transmission of Afro-Brazilian memory and identity. Her books include: 'O Moderno Teatro de Corpo Santo', Editorial UFMG, 1991; 'A Cena em Sombras', Editorial Perspectiva, 1995; 'Afrografias da Memória', Editorial Perspectiva, 1997; and 'Os Dias Anônimos', Editorial Sette Letras 1999.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of Circus Amok's show 'Home * Land * Security', performed at Coney Island in NYC in 2003. The piece ponders the political agendas of the U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, created in response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and a key government department linked to the 'War on Terror'. The performance discusses issues of selective profiling, surveillance, threats to citizenship, and other breaches of privacy in the public and privates spheres of civil society, enacted by the government in the name of 'patriotism' and 'security'. The troupe renders a satirical take on military euphemisms (by the Dame Divas of Military Deconstruction), as well as on the presidency of George W. Bush (through the sing-along picture Ballad of Georgio Bushwack), while advocating for civic critical thinking and a collective demand for a broader sense of security - food, shelter, health care, good art - in a joyful extravaganza of acrobatic artistry, satiric skill, and good old-fashioned circus fun. Circus Amok (www.circusamok.org) is a New York City based circus-theater company whose mission is to provide free public art addressing contemporary issues of social justice to the people of New York City. Directed and founded by Jennifer Miller, the group has been together since 1989 bringing its funny, queer, caustic and sexy, political one-ring spectacles to diverse neighborhoods throughout the city. Over the years the traditional circus skills - tight rope walking, juggling, acrobatics, stilt walking, clowning - have been combined with experimental dance, lifesize puppetry, music old and new, and gender-bending performance art and improvisational techniques, creating new meanings for circus while continuing to entertain the crowds of all ages throughout the city streets, gardens, parks, and playgrounds, inviting the audience to join them in envisioning a more empowered life of community interaction while enjoying a queer celebratory spectacle.

=520  \\$aOriginally conceived in 1998 for two actresses, and later a one-woman show (its final version, here shown), the piece is centered on the labor of waiting. The character represents the many women, at home or in their workplaces, who are living the anguish of waiting for their disappeared family members. We see the woman in her private space, as she performs mundane tasks; as the character attempts to stay engrossed in her housework, traumatic memories of violent events - recorded in her body - are repeated time and again. Lodged in her body, the scars of violence, death, and terror inevitably puncture every gesture, every task. When the character does speak, it is a fragmented collage of commonplace phrases mixed with texts from Rodoreda, Galeano, Borges, Vestrini, and actual testimonies from the families of the disappeared. The actions of the character rise above the silence and make us witnesses of a world plagued by fear, where hope and courage are the unique materials of survival. Teatro La Máscara is the oldest feminist, all-women's theater in Colombia. Founded in 1972 in Cali, La Máscara was a political theater initially comprised of male and female actors; by the early 1980s, when only the women wanted to continue the theatrical trajectory of the group, Lucy Bolaños decided to make it a women's ensemble fully dedicated to a feminine dramaturgy on gender issues. Committed to feminism and social change, they have stayed true to this mission, despite the many social and economic pressures they've had to endure in an environment plagued by violence and machismo, which constantly seeks to 'invisibilize' their work; La Máscara is not only creating and staging plays, but also working with marginalized communities, actively participating in political protests and demonstrations, and being involved in the organization of theater festivals. Through their work, they keep re-thinking women's role in the construction of a peaceful Colombia.

=520  \\$aTeatro La Máscara is the oldest - and one of the only - feminist, all-women's theater in Colombia.

Committed to feminism and social change, they have stayed true to this mission, despite the many social and economic pressures they've had to endure in an environment plagued by violence and machismo, which constantly seeks to 'invisibilize' their work. Because of their fruitful stubbornness, La Máscara is not only creating and staging plays, but also working with marginalized communities, actively participating in political protests and demonstrations, and being involved in the organization of theater festivals. Through their work, they keep re-thinking women's role in the construction of a peaceful Colombia. 'Casa Matriz', a one-act play for two actresses written by Argentine playwright and cartoonist Diana Raznovich, is the story of a search for the perfect mother. Bárbara is turning 30, and as a (very expensive) gift to herself, she decides to hire a 'substitute mother' from a very unique agency, Casa Matriz. This agency - a bizarre mothering equivalent of an escort service - specializes in delivering fully customized mothers-for-a-day to their clients, who shape their ideal matriarch by filling out a form detailing their every emotional need, all the desired characteristics, and the perfect scenario. Using the technique of 'theatre inside of theatre', this comedy provokes laughter and the immediate reflection of the emotional relations between mothers and daughters. It investigates interpersonal communications of everyday people, and critiques the problematic system of family structure.

With the slain rapper as his guide, Wally is witness to the revelations of Tupac in the afterlife. Among regrets of lost love and falling prey to life in the street, Wally learns valuable lessons about life and what you take with you far beyond the grave. Giving Up the Gun is a poignant examination of life, death, and what comes after.

=520  \\$aConcert by Liliana Felipe, presenting the release of her album Trucho. 'Trucho,' an Argentinean adjective meaning 'pirate,' 'illegal,' 'precarious,' 'devalued' or 'false,' encapsulates Felipe's critique on current hemispheric sociopolitical issues, while dedicating her songs to the 'nobodies' (the dispossessed, the disempowered) of Latin America. Songs like 'Como Madame Bovary,' 'Pobre gente,' 'Soñé,' 'La extranjera,' 'Si por el vicio,' 'Tertuliano,' 'Memoria Mnemosina,' 'No te lo puedo decir,' 'Las histéricas' and 'Tienes que decidir,' among others, are performed and commented by Felipe; the encore features Jesusa Rodríguez singing with Felipe a theatrical and comical version of a traditional Mexican huapango. The singers play with diverse vocal registers along with the syllables that form the name of the volcano Popocatepetl, putting the revered song on its head. The couple then sings 'Mujeres del campo,' a hymn composed for a series of workshops conducted with indigenous Mexican peasant women in the summer of 2002. Felipe ends the concert with the tango 'Lo que vos te merecés' by request of her audience, which that night included writer Elena Poniatowska, publicist Berta 'la Chaneca' Maldonado, curator Montserrat Pecanins, actress Ofelia Medina, and deputy Beatriz Paredes, among other renown intellectual, artistic and political figures of current Mexico City public sphere. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodríguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a 'chameleon,' Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her 'espectáculos' (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and 'carpa,' to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguez's energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: 'I am going to die with that woman.' Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. In this off-off space, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas, Jesusa y Liliana have produced hundreds of shows since the 1980s.

=520  \\$aReading of Aristophanes' anti-war comedy 'Lysistrata,' directed in Mexico City by Jesusa Rodríguez and performed by an array of renown artistic and intellectual figures of current Mexican cultural sphere. This event is celebrated in the context of the Lysistrata Project ('The First-Ever Worldwide Theatrical Act Of Dissent') through which on Monday, March 3rd, 2003 (03/03/03), fifty-nine countries hosted 1,029 readings 'to protest the Bush Administration's unilateral war on Iraq' (www.lysistrataproject.com). After the reading, a public forum was celebrated, making an open call to join pacifist/activist efforts to come up with proposals for the denunciation of 'Mexico's national war': the political issue of the murders in Ciudad Juárez. Also, a call was made to boycott American products for two months as a way of protesting the war on Iraq, while demanding, as citizens, a firm repudiation of the war by Mexican President Vicente Fox.

The video set includes footage of mirror reflections, a variety of TV footage (such as a documentary on the Seven World Marvels, a Discovery Channel documentary on the evolutionary future of the species on Earth, an interview and other footage on Mexico's First Lady Marta Sahagún, the theatrical trailer of the film 'Matrix Reloaded,' as well as footage of a race won by Mexico's athlete Ana Gabriela Guevara), and an image of Mexico's flag waving, with the caption 'Fin de la Historia' (End of the story/History). These video inserts are mostly incorporated as projections onstage 'provided' by a magic mirror through which Mexico's former emperor Maximilian of Habsburg, his wife Carlota, and former President Benito Juárez intend to foresee Mexico's 2006 electoral outcome while 'killing time with historic dignity' in a postmodern, satiric waiting game, awaiting the veredict of for 'History's judgment.'

=520  \\$aThis is a video documentation of Open Studio, a space that showcased different work in progress processes. In this rehearsal exploration, the topic of artistic creation’s crisis transverses the stage. ‘Blue Suite’ (aka ‘Eyewitness Blues’) is an affecting portrait of artists and the vibrant culture, traditions, and personal experience they bring to their work. When Junior, a hard-luck horn player prepares to play his instrument, his Duende appears and suddenly his life unfolds in a series of provocative vignettes told through a stirring mix of jazz, flamenco, blues and poetry. Led by his Duende, Junior is forced to confront his own mystery. Here, they battle to the death as Jazz idly argues its own existence. Utilizing Lorca’s Flamenco Duende and summoning Miles Davis’ ‘Sketches of Spain,’ ‘Blue Suite’ takes us on an internal journey, where art lays at the balance as passion fades. This video documentation also features a Q&A with the audience.
=520  \\$aUniverses is a New York-based poetic theatre ensemble company of multi-disciplinary writers and performers who fuse poetry, theater, jazz, hip-hop, politics, down home blues, and Hispanic boleros to create moving, challenging and entertaining theatrical works. The group breaks traditional theatrical bounds to explore new ways of making theater. Founded in New York in 1996, the members of Universes came together in the urban poetry scene of the late 1990s. Through sessions at the New York Theatre Workshop and residencies with New WORLD Theater, their work is now internationally acclaimed. They have performed at venues throughout the United States and toured extensively world-wide.

=511  1\$aNYU students, workshop participants.
=520  \\$aThis performer-training workshop features the rasaboxes exercise devised by Richard Schechner. Michele Minnick and Paula Murray Cole lead the workshop in a yoga warmup, intensive breathing and vocal exercises, slow-motion and other exercises invented or adapted by Schechner, and finally the rasaboxes. Taken as a whole, the workshop is an exploration of psycho-physical embodiments connecting the personal to the social. Rasaboxes offer a unique approach that begins with finding a particular form for the eight basic emotions as specified in the Sanskrit theatre manual, Bharata's 'Natyasastra.' In the workshop documented in the film, four student participants along with the instructors commence with a warm up and then draw words and pictures in each of eight connected rectangular boxes mapped out on the floor with masking tape. The ninth, the center box, is left blank because it represents 'shanta,' the ultimate emotionless state of total bliss. Rasaboxes combines the Indian concept with Antonin Artaud's call for the actor to be 'an athlete of the emotions.' The eight, or nine, rasas of Sanskrit/Indian performance theory are: adbhuta (surprise, wonder), sringara (love, eros), bhayanaka (fear, horror), bibhatsa (disgust, revulsion), vira (courage, the heroic), hasya (laughter, the comic), karuna (sadness, compassion), raudra (rage, destruction), and santa (peace, bliss). Workshop participants move within the boxes, jumping from one emotional state to the other and at times engaging interactively. Richard Schechner is a theater director, performance theorist and university professor known for being one of the founders of the academic discipline of Performance Studies at Tisch School of the Arts, New York University. Schechner combines his work in anthropology with innovative approaches to performance of all kinds including ritual, drama, environmental theater, political rallies, dance, music, etc. in order to consider how performance can be understood not just as an object of study, but also as an active intellectual-artistic practice. He is the editor of 'TDR: The Journal of Performance Studies.' His books include 'Environmental Theater,' 'The Future of Ritual,' 'Performance Theory,' 'Between Theater and Anthropology' and 'Performance Studies: An Introduction.' As of 2007, his books have been translated into 14 languages.

Reverend Billy is a character inhabited by the author/actor William 'Bill' Talen. An invention that resists titles like Performance Artist, Man of God, or Anarchist -- Reverend Billy and his Church of Stop Shopping have become popular as none of the above or as all three. In one form, this project is an interactive play, an evening-length church service that seems to evolve from comedy to some sort of secular spirituality that downtown New York hipsters embrace. Working in 300-seat theaters with large gospel choirs that sing anti-consumerist lyrics ('Stop Shopping! Stop Shopping! Now we can leave the Shopping Malls!'), the Reverend usually works, like a normal church, with a theme at each service. These range from anti-sweatshop concerns, to the neighborhood defense against the economy of tourism, to animal rights. However, Reverend Billy is best known for his Disney and Starbucks store invasions, which also combine the elements of drama, religion and politics. Post-performance discussion led by Jill Lane.

Petrona de la Cruz and Isabel Juárez Espinosa are Mayan Indian playwrights and actresses from Chiapas, Mexico. Pioneers in theatre and social justice in their country, in 1994 they formed the womens cooperative, FOMMA, to empower displaced Indian women and children through workshops in bilingual education (Tzotzil/Tzeltal and Spanish) health programs, job skills and theatre. They have performed in small communities throughout Chiapas as well as at universities and festivals abroad. Forced to leave their native villages at an early age, they became maids in the neighboring mestizo city of San Cristóbal de las Casas. In the '80's they went to work at the fledging Indian writers' cooperative, Sna Jtz'bajom. It was there they became interested in theatre and received training from Ralph Lee of the Metawee River Theatre Company. They have subsequently worked with several other teachers including Amy Trompetter and Luis de Tavira.

=520  \\$aArguably El Teatro Campesinos most famous play, Zoot Suit was originally produced in 1978 at the Mark Taper Form where it ran for an unprecedented twelve weeks and has since then been revived numerous times, including this production in 2003. In 1981, it was adapted into a feature film for Universal Films. Zoot Suit is based on the 1942 Sleepy Lagoon murder mystery and the Zoot Suit Riots that occurred in Los Angeles after that. The riots took place in the racially charged environment of Los Angeles where sailors, soldiers and marines returning from World War II came into conflict with local Mexican zoot suiters. On June 3, 1943 a group of servicemen alleged they had been assaulted by a group of Pachucos, Mexican American youth who had their own subculture during the 1930s and 40s in the American Southwest. They wore distinctive clothing, such as zoot suits, and spoke a dialect, Calo, which is represented in this ETC production; they were often associated with gang activity. A larger group of servicemen gathered in the center of the Mexican community in Los Angeles where they attacked men wearing zoot suits. The police responded by arresting Mexican American youths, who had been attacked in the riots, for disturbing the peace. ETC's Zoot Suit combines fact and fiction to show the fate of 22 Mexican Americans brought to trial for a murder they did not commit. The character of Henry Reyna is based upon real-life zoot suiter Henry Leyvas, who was tried and wrongfully convicted of first-degree murder of Jose Diaz in 1942 (the Sleepy Lagoon murder). Reyna and his friends were set free in 1945 after the Zoot Suit Riots and the banning of zoot suits in Los Angeles in 1944. The goal of this production was to lock into a definitive stage version, while allowing a new generation of artists to take it where they would.

=520  \\$a'La muchacha de los libros usados' tells the story of a girl whose family sold her to a soldier. Her life then unravels as a series of experiences related to the organized, symmetrical life of the army. Still almost a child, the girl is forced by the soldier to live in the barracks, treating her like a prized object. The night he decides to engage in sexual intercourse with her, the girl runs away and is hit by a bus. While struggling between life and death, the girl looks back over events in her life, realizing the symmetries at play in most people's lives, as well as the levels of control and repression enacted by people. The moment she supposedly recovers, she decides to leave her husband/buyer for good. The Grupo de Teatro Malayerba (teatromalayerba.org) was founded in Quito in 1979 by Arístides Vargas, Susana Pautasso and María del Rosario 'Charo' Francés, immigrant actors originally from Argentina and Spain. From the start, Malayerba included actors with various backgrounds and nationalities, invested in the exploration of the rich cultural diversity and complex history of Ecuador, as well as issues of migration, exile, political violence and individual and collective memory. With over 25 years of ongoing theater practice and more than 20 plays performed locally and internationally for a diverse audience, Malayerba is committed to theater pedagogy and experimentation, artistic collaboration, and community building. They have represented Ecuador in national and international theater festivals; they have also collaborated with theater groups within Ecuador and in other countries, and performed for both film and television, while engaging in community work in Quito. In 1989 the group created the Laboratorio Malayerba, committed to the training of generations of young Ecuadorian actors and to an ongoing investigation of theories and practices of experimental theater. In 2001 Malayerba launched the theater journal 'Hoja de Teatro,' conceived as a forum for the theorization, criticism and dissemination of Ecuadorian theater practices. The group also runs a theater house, the Casa Malayerba, which houses the Laboratory as well as a theater with seating capacity for seventy people. Malayerba approaches theater making as an artistic, ethical and technical realm where to engage in meaningful creative experiences through which to understand, assume and confront current sociopolitical processes. In working together, actors with various backgrounds and nationalities have shown that a multicultural blend is not only possible but also enriching, as differences lead to new identities, embodiments of dreams, memories, absences and pains that are at once local and universal.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of Puerto Rican experimental dance performance '¡Uy! -- Opera de Terror,' choreographed by Viveca Vázquez and performed in the University of Puerto Rico, Recinto Río Piedras. Viveca Vázquez is a choreographer, dancer, and a professor of humanities and contemporary dance for actors at the University of Puerto Rico. She presented her first work with Pisotón, the first experimental dance group of Puerto Rico and, shortly after, Taller de Otra Cosa, of which she became the first director. Through the company she presented her choreographic work and produced events such as ‘Rompeforma’ a key festival in the development of the experimental dance and performance scene in Puerto Rico, which was co-produced with Puerto Rican choreographer based in the U.S. Merian Soto. Since 1984 she has produced and performed experimental dance works in the United States, Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina, among a great number of other places. As a teacher she has developed a pedagogical model based on body conscience and improvisation.
=520  \\$a‘¡Uy!’ explores the concept of offering an opera not with voices but with bodies. There is an operatic counterpoint between frightening music and bodies that seem to be lost; between showing and hiding; between light and shadows; and between movements and immobility. These bodies are literally moving in the edge, verging on the unbalance; in this manner, horror seems to be more a state of the body that a state of mind. The stage is divided based on the different rooms that a house can contain -- in this manner, this performance is related to the space as a concept, and to an exploration of memory, fear, and being afraid of fear. ‘¡Uy!’ proposes several questions: What is that which scares us? Our surroundings? Or the objects with which we interact in our everyday life? What is our relationship with our own body? How and when does the body die? How are death and horror related to the death of the body as a corporeal reality?

=520  \\$aThis is a video documentation of the staging of ‘Prometheus,’ performed by the participants of the artistic creation laboratory lead by Mapa Teatro in collaboration with former inhabitants of the neighborhood Santa Inés del Cartucho, demolished during the gentrification process of Bogota’s historic downtown. Along with the performance, this video offers documentation that helps to render the totality of a complex project: the collaborative process between neighbors of El Cartucho and Mapa Teatro, working together in the workshop, as well as a detailed perspective of the recollection of the participants’ memories, and the final event that was the staging of ‘Prometheus.’ The minimal objects rescued by the participants from this erased space, such as chairs, tables, and beds, are in contrast with the open space of the illuminated city – an ironic horizon for stories of loss and displacement. Both through archive images and video, the inhabitants of El Cartucho tell their stories, individually and collectively, and the spectators can get a glimpse of memories that remain after being removed from a space of belonging. One of the most emotive stories is Juana Ramirez’ – who walks through the ruins of what sometime was her house, recollecting little objects and intense memories. The video documentation of this performance suggests the many layers involved in the process of remembering and forgetting: the bodies of these Colombian citizens perform in a space that is not there anymore, neither for them nor for us. In the same way that their presence in a ghostly space activate living memories, Mapa Teatro’s documentation project is an invitation to actively engage with the ongoing process of enacting memory, and to question the guidelines imposed in the name of a progress that intends to erase whatever it considers ‘unacceptable.’
=520  \\$aOne of the foremost artistic companies in Colombia, Mapa Teatro (www.mapateatro.org) has been producing theater, performance and art installation projects since 1984. Founders and directors, Rolf and Heidi Abderhalden have created a wide ranging repertoire of theater, opera, mixed-media performance, and site-specific installation.Their work proposes richly textured visual metaphors in which they consider often complex psychological, social and political relationships. Committed to experimentation, and less interested in the actor as an 'agent of fiction,' they describe their project as 'a laboratory of social imagination,' that offers a space for presenting community issues and human concerns in media and performance. This combination of real-life situations and sites along with highly stylized aesthetic staging produces a tension between real action and (re)presentation. Mapa Teatro draws from live events captured on video such as the demolition of a neighborhood in Bogotá, ritual practice, and texts that explore the relationship of postmodern subjects, myth and metaphor. Mapa Teatro has performed by commissions, festivals and collaborative projects world-wide.

=520  \\$a'Venimos de muy lejos' pays homage to the immigrant ancestors of the people of the neighborhood of La Boca, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The piece is less an anthropological or historical portrait of an era than a theatrical celebration of a neigborhood's collective memory, a carnivalesque depiction of fictional characters from the bit and pieces of real and fictional stories, legends and traditions of the 'Old Countries' that still haunt and feed the neighborhood's collective imaginary. The piece is, as theater group Catalinas Sur points out, a tribute to their ancestor's hopes, sufferings and yearnings as uprooted migrants, to the solidarity and daily toils at play in the neighborhood's public spaces, to the joy of their songs and their celebrations, to their love and their struggle for survival. The idea of Grupo de Teatro Catalinas Sur (www.catalinasur.com.ar) came to life during a neighborhood barbeque held by a school's parents association in 1983. It was during the time of Argentina's military dictatorship, which stifled popular expression, and the theater group used its community service as a form of resistance that strengthened feelings of solidarity and mutual binding. The group remains rooted in its Buenos Aires neighborhood, even as its membership and fame has grown, performing in a converted warehouse. Catalinas Sur members are acknowledged followers of the traditional artistic forms performed in the quarter which has been the birthplace of the popular arts: puppeteers, musicians, actors, artists originating from the old continent or from Latin America and who mingled their art, like a crucible, with the neighborhood. Firm believers that society can be changed by teamwork and a sense of community, Catalinas Sur has created more than 20 plays and, sweeping aside all false generation gaps, has now over 300 actors. In their own words, 'with the advent of this globalized and inhumane millennium, we are attempting, through the theater, to remember the value of our individual and collective histories, and revive the memory that believed and believes in a better world.'

=520  \\$aJavier Cardona is a Puerto Rican dancer/actor and pedagogue. Trained on Puerto Rico within the graphic-dramatic experimental Project Los Teatreros Ambulantes de Cayey of the University of Puerto Rico under the artistic direction of pedagogues/artists Rosa Luisa Márquez and Antonio Martorell, Javier has also worked and trained with renowned international theater artists like Miguel Rubio (Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani, Peru), Osvaldo Dragún (Argentina, EITALC), Augusto Boal (Theater of the Oppressed, Brazil), and Peter Schumman (Bread and Puppet Theater, United States). Through his experiences in theater, Javier explores experimental dance, training with Gloria Llompart and Viveca Vázquez in Puerto Rico, as well as dancing with choreographers Sally Silvers and Jennifer Monson in New York City. He has worked in community-based theater educational programs, and is a member of the Taller de Otra Cosa, a collaborative cultural organization that promotes artistic educational programs in communities and the development of experimental performing arts events. As a choreographer and director, Javier explores issues of gender and race, rooted in his experiences as an Afro Puerto Rican queer artist working in Caribbean, Latin American and American societies. His dance/theater piece 'Ah-mén', created in 2004, is an exploration of masculinity as a social construct. Through the recreation of visual, verbal and bodily texts, six dancer/actors perform the intricate networks of prescription, transmission and enforcement of normative masculinity as maintained by social institutions such as family, church, school and the state. By rendering evident the dynamics of power and violence linked to notions and expectations of masculinity in our collective unconscious, the performers provoke the audience to re-think our preconceptions of what means to 'be a man'.

=520  \\$aSusana Cook (www.susanacook.com) is a New York-based Argentinean theater and performance artist. Mainly directed to queer and Latino communities in New York City, Cook's work also encompasses a heated response to broader State policies that oppress communities defined in the intersection of race, gender, and class. In her shows, Cook parodies discourses of power, drawing attention to the close ties between the state, religious and political conservatism, and the military. Cook's plays usually feature all-women casts that defy the normative performance of gender, race, and sexuality. '100 years of Attitude' mocks the title of the Latin American novel 'One Hundred Years of Solitude' by Gabriel García Márquez. The play approaches the theme of execution, imperialism, invasion, and colonialism making several explicit references to the war in Afghanistan, the invasion of Iraq, and the official discourse of the US president George W. Bush's administration regarding the role of the United States in the international context. The play talks about the end of the world as a subjective experience, that is captured in the following sentence: 'When everybody around you is dying... that's the end of the world.' In the piece, a Christian executioner prays before killing and an American family comes to live in town taking over the local homes. The people of this fictional lesbian town are executed several times, always coming back to life; the life of a community prevails over that of the individual. Some other themes that appear in the show, that are a constant in Cooks work, are the theme of the 'Hero' - through references to Odysseus - and the corrupting effect of power.

=520  \\$a'Malayerba: 25 años de teatro' is a documentary prepared by this Ecuadorian theater ensemble as an overview of the first 25 years of artistic trajectory. Weaving interviews with founding members and artistic directors María del Rosario 'Charo' Francés and Arístides Vargas, and illustrated through video and photo documentation, the documentary portrays the history and creative coordinates of the Grupo Malayerba, the presence of exile as life experience and creative motif, their constant investigation of theater theory and practices, their development of a distinctive dramaturgy of the actor, the playwright and the director, as well as the collaborative processes of artistic creation with local and international artists. Renowned plays by the group, like 'La Fanesca,' 'Jardín de Pulpos,' 'Pluma y la tempestad,' 'Nuestra Señora de las Nubes,' 'El deseo más canalla,' 'La muchacha de los libros usados,' and 'Donde el viento hace buñuelos' are featured in this video, commented on by Francés and Vargas and contextualized in the bigger picture of the outstanding theater work by Ecuador's most important theater group. The Grupo de Teatro Malayerba (teatromalayerba.org) was founded in Quito in 1979 by Arístides Vargas, Susana Pautasso and María del Rosario 'Charo' Francés, immigrant actors originally from Argentina and Spain. From the start, Malayerba included actors with various backgrounds and nationalities, invested in the exploration of the rich cultural diversity and complex history of Ecuador, as well as issues of migration, exile, political violence and individual and collective memory. With over 25 years of ongoing theater practice and more than 20 plays performed locally and internationally for a diverse audience, Malayerba is committed to theater pedagogy and experimentation, artistic collaboration, and community building. They have represented Ecuador in national and international theater festivals; they have also collaborated with theater groups within Ecuador and in other countries, and performed for both film and television, while engaging in community work in Quito. In 1989 the group created the Laboratorio Malayerba, committed to the training of generations of young Ecuadorian actors and to an ongoing investigation of theories and practices of experimental theater. In 2001 Malayerba launched the theater journal 'Hoja de Teatro,' conceived as a forum for the theorization, criticism and dissemination of Ecuadorian theater practices. The group also runs a theater house, the Casa Malayerba, which houses the Laboratory as well as a theater with seating capacity for seventy people. Malayerba approaches theater making as an artistic, ethical and technical realm where to engage in meaningful creative experiences through which to understand, assume and confront current sociopolitical processes. In working together, actors with various backgrounds and nationalities have shown that a multicultural blend is not only possible but also enriching, as differences lead to new identities, embodiments of dreams, memories, absences and pains that are at once local and universal.

=520  \\$aNayra is collective creation of La Candelaria that explores the unconscious and the popular worldview about health, death, and displacement. 'Nayra' is an Aymara word that means 'eye,' but can also mean 'ancestors,' 'memory' and 'vision.' Director Santiago García describes the piece as 'an exploration of our myths and legends as both Colombians and Latin Americans.' This piece enacts a time/space of assemblages that address the quest for connections more than the connections per se. By the end of the piece, mirrors blow to pieces, thus recalling not only a fragmented shared memory, but also a country crushed by violence.
=520  \\$aLa Candelaria was founded in 1966 by a group of independent artists and intellectuals who came from experimental theater and the broader Colombian cultural movement. Directed by Santiago García, La Candelaria is one of Colombian theater's most innovative agents, modernizing national drama while addressing popular audiences. By means of an ongoing exploration of national folklore, situations and characters, they have created some of Colombia's most compelling plays, some of them through the method of 'creación colectiva' ('collective creation'), addressing the acute social and political problems of their society. At the same time, they fostered the creation of Corporación Colombiana del Teatro and have developed a number of theoretical works that reflect upon dramatic creation, its methods and languages. Still nowadays, La Candelaria is committed to repertoire, experimentation, and discussion as fundamental elements to artistic creation.

=520  \\$aRosa Luisa Márquez (www.marquezmartorell.org) is a Puerto Rican theater artist and pedagogue. Founding member of the theater group Anamú in 1971, she holds a Master's degree from New York University and a Doctorate from Michigan State University; she specializes in contemporary theater. Rosa Luisa started her teaching career at the Theater department of the University of Puerto Rico in 1978. She developed the current curriculum of Drama Activities, which she teaches in her workshops at schools, prisons, rehab centers, women's shelters, nursing homes and community centers. Her directing projects include 'Romeo(s) y Julieta(s),' 'Historias para ser Contadas,' 'La Leyenda del Cemí,' 'Procesión,' 'Waiting for Godot,' 'Jardín de Pulpos,' 'Absurdos en Soledad,' 'El León y la Joya,' among others. In conjunction with Puerto Rican visual artist Antonio Martorell, she created the concept of Itinerant Performers (1987-1990) resulting in twelve productions. Published books include 'Brincos y saltos: el juego como disciplina teatral' and 'Historias para ser contadas, montaje de Rosa Luisa Márquez.' She is a member of the board of directors and pedagogical team for the EITALC's International School of Latin American and Caribbean Theater. Ongoing artistic collaborators include Gilda Navarra and Antonio Martorell (Puerto Rico), Grupo Malayerba (Ecuador), Grupo Yuyachkani (Peru), and directors Peter Shumann (Bread & Puppet Theater, U.S.A.) and Augusto Boal (Theater of the Oppressed, Brazil). 'Donde el Viento Hace Buñuelos' crystallizes an ongoing collaboration process between Ecuadorian theater ensemble Grupo de Teatro Malayerba and Puerto Rican artists Rosa Luisa Márquez and Antonio Martorell. Collaboratively created through the improvisational input of actresses María del Rosario 'Charo' Francés and Rosa Luisa Márquez, the directorial and dramaturgical vision of Arístides Vargas, and the visual and spatial transformations of Antonio Martorell, 'Buñuelos' portrays the multiple encounters of two friends in time and space. Between life and death, memories and games, Catalina and Miranda weave their relationship, a virtual motherland amidst political and emotional exile. Music by Puerto Rican artist María Pilar Aponte (who performs an enigmatic character, an Angel of Death of sorts) complements their journey.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of Circus Amok's piece, Back to School Show, performed in 2004 in diverse NYC parks, squares and other public spaces. Through the motif of the beginning of the academic year, and in the context of the upcoming U.S. presidential elections that same year, the troupe poses a critique of issues of standardization and accountability, directed both to the public school system and to Republican U.S. President George W. Bush's administration (and its protagonic role in the Iraq War that started in March 2003). The show poses a public call to civic empowerment and critical thinking, claiming social justice through a variety of interwoven skits that honor local and international pedagogues while performing a satirical commentary on the political climate of the moment, in a joyful extravaganza of acrobatic artistry, satiric skill, and good old-fashioned circus fun. Circus Amok (www.circusamok.org) is a New York City based circus-theater company whose mission is to provide free public art addressing contemporary issues of social justice to the people of New York City. Directed and founded by Jennifer Miller, the group has been together since 1989 bringing its funny, queer, caustic and sexy, political one-ring spectacles to diverse neighborhoods throughout the city. Over the years the traditional circus skills - tight rope walking, juggling, acrobatics, stilt walking, clowning - have been combined with experimental dance, lifesize puppetry, music old and new, and gender-bending performance art and improvisational techniques, creating new meanings for circus while continuing to entertain the crowds of all ages throughout the city streets, gardens, parks, and playgrounds, inviting the audience to join them in envisioning a more empowered life of community interaction while enjoying a queer celebratory spectacle.

=520  \\$aCabaret performance by Jesusa Rodríguez and Liliana Felipe, exploring the downside of social indifference and the power of civil disobedience as an effective form of civic participation through which to enact political, cultural and social changes in the public sphere. An anthropologist for 'Discovery Chafa' (a parody of ethnographic documentaries on American television) researches a tribe of Latin American indigenous people, the 'Yanomami', joining them in a continental search for their lost gods. Western and Eastern cultures - characterized as representing 'el Tener' (to have) and 'el Ser' (to be), respectively - are represented as two pseudo gods attempting to be recognized as the 'universal' Culture. Countering this battle of wills, the piece propose (through satiric eschatological dialogues and parodic twists) a rupture of the Manichean East/West binary, favoring a 'third option', that of 'Saber Estar' (to know how to be in a place), attributed to native civilizations; this option intends to open up a space for empowering and incorporating indigenous people in contemporary national projects - projects which tend to isolate them in discourses of Romantic myths of origin, while being considered technologically and culturally 'backward'. Furthermore, the artists invite the audience to have a critical approach not only to foreign political and cultural agendas, but more urgently, to Mexico's current governmental agendas (among them, the effects of NAFTA on civil society). Civil disobedience is proposed as an effective tool for civic participation; the audience is invited to join the 'Enemigos de Fox' club (a fictional opposition club against Mexican president Vicente Fox) and to publicly express their discontent with the political and economic situation of contemporary Mexico. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodríguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a 'chameleon,' Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her 'espectáculos' (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and 'carpa,' to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguez's energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations - especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: 'I am going to die with that woman.' Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. In this off-off space, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas, Jesusa y Liliana have produced hundreds of shows since the 1980s.

=520  \\$aIn this bilingual 'pre-Hispanic' cabaret performance, Jesusa Rodríguez and Liliana Felipe perform some of their staple characters and songs, in a satiric commentary on how US foreign policy, neoliberalism, and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) are affecting Latin America. 'Freaka Kahlo,' 'la Serpiente Enchilada' and the 'Coatlicue' are some of the queer 'arquetypical' characters performed by Rodríguez; through ingenious neologisms and humorous wordplay, they pose a critique to consumer society, repressive US policies against illegal migrants, the imposition of transgenic corn in Mexico (which is currently endangering the ecodiversity of native corn), and the opening of an American megastore (the controversial Walmart) nearby the pre-Columbian pyramids of Teotihuacán. Renown songs by Felipe - 'Tienes que decidir,' 'Mala,' 'El maíz,' among others - provide a powerful antiphonal commentary on these issues, bringing together the social and the personal in a engaging take on queer politics. The artists close the performance with their famous song 'Popocateptl,' a parodic version of Mexican composer José Pablo Moncayo's most well-known work, 'Huapango.' Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodríguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a 'chameleon,' Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones.

Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. Rodriguez's energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. In this interview the artist comments on her particular use and transformation of the genre of 'pastorela' (Nativity play) in her cabaret performances, as a tool for contesting political and religious fundamentalism in the Americas. The pastorelas, used by the Catholic Church as an evangelization tool during the Conquest, are usually based on a clean-cut distinction between Good and Evil, sustaining a binary thought that has fueled political, cultural and religious agendas in the American hemisphere. Rodríguez proposal to use the pastorela genre against the ideologically conservative institutions that originally introduced and used it, subversively mixes humor with religion in order to contest the Manichean politics at play in contemporary Western society. Performances like 'Concilio de Amor' and 'Pastorela Terrorista' are commented by the artist as examples of this performative strategy, which Rodríguez links to a broader concern with civic empowerment and education, issues of civil disobedience and popular participation.

=520  \\$aCabaret performance posing a satiric take on the Manichean thought fueling current Western (conservative) religion, pedagogy, and politics. Farsical characters evidence an Orwellian 'doublethink', engaging in demagogical discourses of self-righteousness while evidencing the power games at play in school, church, and government. In the context of the US war on Iraq (2003), its Coalition of the Willing and War on Terrorism, a fascist teacher and a flock of 'angels' (political leaders Blair, Aznar, Sharon and Bush) stretch language in rhetorical twists aimed at demonstrating a clear-cut distinction between Good and Evil. A 'pastorela' (Nativity play) evidences their take on terrorism. As an alternative to this political stance, a parodic pseudo-religion or self-help workshop, the 'Sagrada Iglesia del Intermedio' (a pun translated as Sacred Church of Intermission or Sacred Church of the In-Between) is introduced by the Goddess of the Interstice, Uncertainty, Paradox and Pleasure (played by Jesusa Rodríguez), advocate of unveiling the ideological agendas underlying binary thought, proposing instead a relativistic gesture of ludic intermediation. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodréguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a 'chameleon,' Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her 'espectáculos' (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and 'carpa,' to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguez's energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: 'I am going to die with that woman.' Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. In this off-off space, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas, Jesusa y Liliana have produced hundreds of shows since the 1980s.

=520  \\$aThe video tape begins with people arriving and mingling during a reception held in the Dean's Conference room at the Tisch School of the Arts, New York University. Thirty to 50 people gather and talk in small groups while the camera moves among them, recording parts of their conversations. Michele Minnick, a member of the ECA, is host for the event. Soon, people find chairs arranged around a large rectangular grid of boxes made of tape on the floor: the rasaboxes. Richard Schechner announces the beginning of the event and suggests that the audience consider the work of ECA as a 'rethinking the arts.' He discusses the rasaboxes work as a way for performers to express emotions immediately, without forethought or emotional recall - or any other standard actors' exercises. Paula Murray Cole explains the grid on the floor - the outline of the nine rasas. Rasaboxes offer a unique approach to enacting the eight basic emotions as specified in the Sanskrit theater manual, Bharata's 'Natyasastra.' The ninth, the center box, is left blank because it represents 'shanta,' the ultimate emotionless state of total bliss. Rasaboxes combines the Indian concept with Antonin Artaud's call for the actor to be 'an athlete of the emotions.' The eight, or nine, rasas of Sanskrit/Indian performance theory are: adbhuta (surprise, wonder), sringara (love, eros), bhayanaka (fear, horror), bibhatsa (disgust, revulsion), vira (courage, the heroic), hasya (laughter, the comic), karuna (sadness, compassion), raudra (rage, destruction), and santa (peace, bliss). Workshop participants move within the boxes, jumping from one emotional state to the other and at times engaging interactively. Then ECA members demonstrate the rasaboxes technique. Several speakers, including Richard Schechner describe the RasaBoxes technique and its usefulness in a variety of contexts. Richard Schechner is a theater director, performance theorist and university professor known for being one of the founders of the academic discipline of Performance Studies at Tisch School of the Arts, New York University. Schechner combines his work in anthropology with innovative approaches to performance of all kinds including ritual, drama, environmental theater, political rallies, dance, music, etc. in order to consider how performance can be understood not just as an object of study, but also as an active intellectual-artistic practice. He is the editor of 'TDR: The Journal of Performance Studies.' His books include 'Environmental Theater,' 'The Future of Ritual,' 'Performance Theory,' 'Between Theater and Anthropology' and 'Performance Studies: An Introduction.' As of 2007, his books have been translated into 14 languages.

=520  \\$a'Donde el viento hace buñuelos' crystallizes an ongoing artistic collaboration Teatro Malayerba (Ecuador) and Rosa Luisa Márquez (Puerto Rico), produced under the name Suda-k-ribe. Collaboratively created through improvisations by actresses María del Rosario 'Charo' Francés and Rosa Luisa Márquez, the directorial and dramaturgical vision of Arístides Vargas, and the visual and spatial transformations by Puerto Rican artist Antonio Martorell, the play portrays the close relationship between two friends, developed in multiple encounters through time and space in the slippery territory of memory. The characters share the encounters and disencounters experienced while living in countries traversed by borders, incommunication, censorship, indifference and violence. Between life and death, memories and games, Catalina and Miranda weave their relationship, turning friendship into a community of affect, a virtual homeland of solidarity where to live amidst political and spiritual exile. Music by Puerto Rican artist María Pilar Aponte (who performs an enigmatic character, an Angel of Death of sorts) complements their journey between exile and memory, uprootedness and solidarity. The Grupo de Teatro Malayerba (teatromalayerba.org) was founded in Quito in 1979 by Arístides Vargas, Susana Pautasso and María del Rosario 'Charo' Francés, immigrant actors originally from Argentina and Spain. From the start, Malayerba included actors with various backgrounds and nationalities, invested in the exploration of the rich cultural diversity and complex history of Ecuador, as well as issues of migration, exile, political violence and individual and collective memory. With over 25 years of ongoing theater practice and more than 20 plays performed locally and internationally for a diverse audience, Malayerba is committed to theater pedagogy and experimentation, artistic collaboration, and community building. They have represented Ecuador in national and international theater festivals; they have also collaborated with theater groups within Ecuador and in other countries, and performed for both film and television, while engaging in community work in Quito. In 1989 the group created the Laboratorio Malayerba, committed to the training of generations of young Ecuadorian actors and to an ongoing investigation of theories and practices of experimental theater. In 2001 Malayerba launched the theater journal 'Hoja de Teatro,' conceived as a forum for the theorization, criticism and dissemination of Ecuadorian theater practices. The group also runs a theater house, the Casa Malayerba, which houses the Laboratory as well as a theater with seating capacity for seventy people. Malayerba approaches theater making as an artistic, ethical and technical realm where to engage in meaningful creative experiences through which to understand, assume and confront current sociopolitical processes. In working together, actors with various backgrounds and nationalities have shown that a multicultural blend is not only possible but also enriching, as differences lead to new identities, embodiments of dreams, memories, absences and pains that are at once local and universal.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of Puerto Rican experimental dance performance ‘Plagio,’ choreographed by Viveca Vázquez, who is a choreographer, dancer, and a professor of humanities and contemporary dance for actors at the University of Puerto Rico. She presented her first work with Pisotón, the first experimental dance group of Puerto Rico and, shortly after, Taller de Otra Cosa, of which she became the first director. Through the company she presented her choreographic work and produced events such as ‘Rompeforma’ a key festival in the development of the experimental dance and performance scene in Puerto Rico, which was co-produced with Puerto Rican choreographer based in the U.S. Merian Soto. Since 1984 she has produced and performed experimental dance works in the United States, Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina, among a great number of other places. As a teacher she has developed a pedagogical model based on body conscience and improvisation.
=520  \\$a‘Plagio’ was performed in the Estudios Generales Letras building, at the University of Puerto Rico. While taking over the space with bodies, sound, voices, and movement, Vázquez performed a double gesture, bringing a canonic text to the dance, and bringing it in dance to non-conventional spaces. The reverberation of voices and movement resembles the idea of plagiarism (‘plagio’), which in this case is understood as a re-enactment and re-creation of the classics. This video documentary is described as a ‘Piece of dance-theater inspired in Augustine of Hippo.’ The implications of bringing Saint Augustine to the University of Puerto Rico engage this performance with contemporary concerns, related to the discussion on colonialism and post-colonialism. Also, including new codes and forms of expression such as rap music stages the dialogue and counterpoint between our times and the classic texts. This video as a ‘documentary by Miguel Villafañe, ‘plagiarism’ of a performance by Viveca Vázquez, in turn a ‘plagiarism’ of Saint Augustine of Hippo’s life and works.’ With this playful idea, this performance and its video documentary offer a rich line of discussion about re-creations: if this documentary is a ‘plagiarism’ of a ‘plagiarism’ of a ‘plagiarism,’ perhaps its presence in the Hemispheric Institute Digital Video Library could be considered another ‘plagiarism’ in the series of re-enactments that are at the basis of our cultural constructions.

=520  \\$aSusana Baca is the foremost singer of Afro-Peruvian music. Her music, on the Luaka Bop label, has promoted an awareness of the many cultural contributions of Afro-Peruvians. Also to this aim, she and her husband Ricardo Pereira are the founders and co-directors of the Instituto Negrocontinuo in Lima. She dedicated this concert in Belo Horizonte to women, and--with her infinite grace, her wide smile, her sensuous movements and her bare feet on stage--she performed songs like 'Molino Molero,' 'Caracunde,' 'Corazón Americano' (in honor of Milton Nascimento), 'Panalivio,' 'Toro Mata,' and 'Se me van los pies.' This concert was performed at the Palácio das Artes in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, as a part of the the 5th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, titled Performing Heritage: Contemporary Indigenous and Community-Based Practices (http://hemisphericinstitute.org/eng/seminar/brazil2005/index.html).The concert was followed by a post-performance discussion with the audience.

=520  \\$a'O sos o no sos' is Catalinas Sur's second puppet theater show, a beautiful spectacle for all ages following their first puppetry piece 'La Niña de la Noche.' It is a free adaptation of Frank Tashlin's story 'The Bear that Wasn't.' The piece tells the adventures and exploits of a bear that wakes up from his winter hibernation to find an industrial complex where his cave used to be. The bear then gets confused by the factory foreman as a human worker and is told to work; each of his successive bosses tries to convince him that he is just a 'silly man.' Throughout the play, the bear tries to protect his very identity while trying to survive in a confusing, threatening world to which he does not belong. Music, color, masks, a beautiful set and a delightful soundtrack, along with 22 puppeteers-performers under the direction of Ximena Bianchi, give life to 35 puppets in order to recreate the story of a bear lost in a world of men, a struggle for the preservation of identity against all odds. The idea of Grupo de Teatro Catalinas Sur (www.catalinasur.com.ar) came to life during a neighborhood barbeque held by a school's parents association in 1983. It was during the time of Argentina's military dictatorship, which stifled popular expression, and the theater group used its community service as a form of resistance that strengthened feelings of solidarity and mutual binding. The group remains rooted in its Buenos Aires neighborhood, even as its membership and fame has grown, performing in a converted warehouse. Catalinas Sur members are acknowledged followers of the traditional artistic forms performed in the quarter which has been the birthplace of the popular arts: puppeteers, musicians, actors, artists originating from the old continent or from Latin America and who mingled their art, like a crucible, with the neighborhood. Firm believers that society can be changed by teamwork and a sense of community, Catalinas Sur has created more than 20 plays and, sweeping aside all false generation gaps, has now over 300 actors. In their own words, 'with the advent of this globalized and inhumane millennium, we are attempting, through the theater, to remember the value of our individual and collective histories, and revive the memory that believed and believes in a better world.'

'Cobra Norato' explores aquatic myths of the Amazonian region. Written by Raul Bopp, its one of the most important poems of the Modernismo Brasileiro. The Giramundo piece features puppets created in the style of traditional Carajá craftsmanship and inspired by popular art from Northern and Northeastern Brazil. Created in 1970 by Brazilian artists Álvaro Apocalypse, Terezinha Veloso and Maria do Carmo Vivacqua Martins (Madu), Giramundo Teatro de Bonecos (www.giramundo.org) has gained worldwide recognition as one of the most important puppet theater groups in the world. Their remarkable trajectory includes professional works for theater, film, video, and television, as well as a strong pedagogical component, teaching workshops and puppetry courses both abroad and in their own school in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Every year, besides setting up a new show, the group works on a remake. The 950 marionettes that have already staged or that are still on stage are part of the Museu Giramundo collection, which has the largest private collection of the kind in Brazil. At the Museum we can also find the Coleção de Desenhos e Estudos para Teatro, with sketches and outlines for set design, and the models of the groups creators. The methodological rigor in creating their performances, the refined construction and manipulation of their performing objects, and their interest in exploring topics in Brazilian culture have provided Giramundo with tools for transcending traditional childrens theater in order to incorporate adult themes and cultural forms in direct dialogue with complex political and aesthetic issues.

=520  \\$aLuisa Calcumil is a Mapuche actress, director and playwright from the South of Argentina (Patagonia). She began her career as an actress in 1975. After performing in twenty plays, five films and various television programs, she felt she was not represented in the roles she played. So she decided to write her own scripts: 'Hebras' and 'Es bueno mirarse en la propia sombra.' In this interview, conducted by Diana Taylor at the Hemispheric Institutes 5th Encuentro (Belo Horizonte, Brazil, 2005), Luisa begins by introducing herself in Mapudungún (her indigenous language), saying, 'I am a person of the land, the land down south that our dear ancestors called Cold Swamp but is now known as General Roca With the protection of the Great Mother of the Sky, the Great Father of the Sky, the Young Woman and the Young Man of the Sky I have been able to arrive here today.' She tells the story of her difficult childhood and how she came to the world of theater. She also discusses her solo performance, 'Es bueno mirarse en la propia sombra' ('Its Good to See Ourselves in Our Own Shadow'), which she presented at the Encuentro. Through her work, she wishes to transmit the Mapuche worldview, which she says is different from that of 'the white world', being mainly oral and musical. She wants to break with stereotypes of indigenous peoples, who have been so widely represented by others; she calls for self-representation, respect for traditions and the renewal of hope for her community.

=520  \\$aLuisa Calcumil's 1987 solo show, 'Es bueno mirarse en la propia sombra' is a plea for the preservation of Mapuche indigenous culture in the face of the homogenizing forces of globalization. The play opens with Calcumil's voice in the dark, introducing herself in the Mapuche language as 'a person of the earth.' We then see her as a grandmother singing in Mapuche and being killed by white invaders who destroy indigenous land and build nuclear dumps. Next is the story of Julia and her mother: in dire financial straits, Julia's mother is forced to send Julia to work in the city as a maid. After many years, she goes back for her, only to find out she?s left her job and given birth to a boy. Calcumil then transforms into Julia, dancing to pop music, wearing flashy clothes. Julia constantly tells herself, 'You're so beautiful, Julia!' 'Why think?' 'Your skin is whiter!' She wants to forget she was raped, forget where she came from, forget she is Mapuche. But even as she calls herself Julie and gets a Western education, her dead grandmother appears in her dreams singing traditional songs, relentlessly reminding her that she can't deny her roots. This video documents Calcumil's performance at the Teatro da Cidade in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, as a part of the 5th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, titled Performing Heritage: Contemporary Indigenous and Community-Based Practices (http://hemisphericinstitute.org/eng/seminar/brazil2005/index.html).

=520  \\$aKeynote address delivered by Mary Schmidt Campbell at the Hemispheric Institute's 5th Encuentro in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, in 2005 (http://hemi.nyu.edu/eng/seminar/brazil2005). Titled The Role of the Arts in a Time of Crisis, the keynote addressed the theme of the role of artists and intellectuals in times of cultural, political and economic crisis. Ms. Campbell focused her lecture on the current cultural climate in the United States, from the culture wars of the 1980s to issues of surveillance and fear surrounding the Patriot Act, paying special attention to considerations of civil liberties and the public expression of dissent. By means of examples of how works by 20th century artists engage with their political and social contexts, Campbell emphasized the critical role of artists, intellectuals and educators in terms of social conscience, moral critique, and collective action. Scholar, author and former New York City Cultural Affairs Commissioner, Ms. Campbell was, at the time of her keynote address, Dean of the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University. Dr. Campbell began her career in New York as the executive director of the Studio Museum in Harlem, widely regarded as the principal center for the study of African and African-American Art. Dean Campbell, who authored several catalogues on African-American artists, and frequently curated major exhibitions, firmly established the Museum as a major New York City cultural institution. In 1999, Crain's New York selected her as one of the City's 100 Most Influential Women in business, and in 2001 she was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Dean Campbell co-authored the books Harlem Renaissance: Art of Black America and Memory and Metaphor: The Art of Romare Bearden, 1940-1987. A noted expert on the artist Romare Bearden, Dr. Campbell also lectures and publishes widely on a range of subjects including arts policy issues and American cultural history.

Based in New York City, they are also members of danza Mexica Cetiliztli, New York Zapatistas and the American Indian Community House. 'Caracol, Corazón de la Tierra, Flor de la Esperanza' was created after the Colorado sisters lived and worked with communities in five autonomous municipalities in Chiapas, México. Their text is weaved from the voices of the Zapatista indigenous women they encountered. It is a collage of their thoughts, stories and music: the fire of their resistance, struggle and hope for a better future. This play was performed at the Francisco Nunes theater in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, as a part of the 5th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, titled Performing Heritage: Contemporary Indigenous and Community-Based Practices (http://hemisphericinstitute.org/eng/seminar/brazil2005/index.html).

=520  \\$aSusana Cook (www.susanacook.com) is a New York-based Argentinean theater and performance artist. Mainly directed to queer and Latino communities in New York City, Cook's work also encompasses a heated response to broader State policies that oppress communities defined in the intersection of race, gender, and class. In her shows, Cook parodies discourses of power, drawing attention to the close ties between the state, religious and political conservatism, and the military. Cook's plays usually feature all-women casts that defy the normative performance of gender, race, and sexuality. 'The Values Horror Show' was written as a response to the 2004 US election campaign ran by the Neo-conservatist agenda that claimed to protect 'family values' and 'the sanctity of marriage'. While proclaiming themselves as defenders of traditional values in America, the Neo-conservatists did not intervene in matters of murder, war, poverty, and genocide that came along. The show starts with a war. Two armies are fighting for God and they have similar prophets and commandments. It is confusing who is fighting in what army. During the show, the soldiers become the workers who end up confronting Lady Incorporated, a character that represents capitalism. Throughout the play, Cook interweaves American traditional values with the current policies against ethnic minorities other marginalized sectors of American society.

=520  \\$aDedicated to 'the poet Oswald de Andrade and to the businessman, showman, and actor Sílvio Santos,' the third part of the book tells the causing incident of the war, when a judge from Juazeiro stopped a shipment of wood that was paid for from being delivered for the construction of the New Church of Canudos. Three expeditions were sent by the National Army and defeated, the last one commanded by the famous Colonel Moreira César. The Army faced the humiliation of soldiers deserting and running away, and the impaling of Colonel Tamarindo. He ended up being the main character in a macabre installation on the road to Canudos, created by the Jagunços (thugs from the sertão) and the Mandrakes to intimidate new expeditions. The first movement of A Luta is written in cordel verse (popular string literature form). A Luta I also amplifies the performance space, with trench houses from the invincible Canudos that effectively form a spinal cord in the runway, and the aerial spaces of the mutãs, hideouts used by the Indians in the top branches of trees to hunt the jaguar, which the followers of Antônio Conselheiro reinvented. Lirinha, a musician from the Pernambuco band Cordel do Fogo Encantado, brought his passion for soundtracks, recording sounds from the theater itself, and transforming them into shots, artillery, creating with music the vanguard of the fight. The physical space of the performance is extended to the world, with recorded images, sampled, embroidered, in the streets that surround the theater, in the dressing rooms, in places hidden from the direct sight of the audience, making live cinema.
=520  \\$aFrom 2000 to 2007, Teat(r)o Oficina Uzyna Uzona worked on the staging of Euclides da Cunha's epic book, Os Sertões, which describes the 19th Century War of Canudos in the Brazilian 'sertão,' lead by Antônio Conselheiro. The final result was a pentalogy, formed by the plays A Terra (2002), O Homem I (2003), O Homem II (2003), A Luta I (2005), and A Luta II (2006), totalizing 27 hours of theater. Os Sertões reads the episodes of the war in light of past and present Brazilian history, and in relation to the struggle of the group against media mogul Sílvio Santos, who wanted to tear down the historic theater.

=520  \\$aFortaleza de la Mujer Maya (FOMMA) is run by Petrona de la Cruz Cruz and Isabel Juárez Espinosa in Chiapas, Mexico. Their programs educate indigenous women and children in Tzeltal, Tzotzil and Spanish as well as offering an extensive array of vocational skills and theater workshops. FOMMA also provides services like childcare, women's rights education and healthcare. Partly based on Isabel's life, their play 'Soledad y Esperanza' is the story of two young indigenous sisters who have suffered physical and emotional abuse throughout their lives. Esperanza dreams of an education and of life in the big city. But her older sister Soledad denies her the chance to go to school and instead forces her to work as a maid for a dominating mestiza in the city. Despite the challenges she faces in this environment, Esperanza falls in love with Juan, the gardener. Once they're married, Juan and his new family return to his community, where he owns fertile lands that promise economic stability. Their happiness is short-lived, however, as Juan is brutally murdered by enemies who desire his property. Esperanza, alone and pregnant, sees no future in staying there. She decides to leave on an uncertain journey towards the border, dreaming of a better life. This piece was performed at the Francisco Nunes theater in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, as a part of the 5th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, titled Performing Heritage: Contemporary Indigenous and Community-Based Practices (http://hemisphericinstitute.org/eng/seminar/brazil2005/index.html).

=520  \\$aModeled after El Camino de Compostela in Spain, artist Nicolás Dumit Estévez embarks on a series of seven pilgrimages, from Lower Manhattan to seven different museums on foot. With a heavy load of donated art publications strapped to his back, the artist reverses the relationship between art and religion with religion becoming a tool in the service of art. The artist has a large amount of donated art publications strapped to his back for a trip that took him from Lower Manhattan to East Harlem. El Museo del Barrio's Director Julián Zugazagoitia commemorates the performance by signing the artist's passport and Martha Wilson performs departed blessings.

=520  \\$a'Nock-ma' is a largely improvised three-hour collaboration between Guillermo Gómez-Peña (Mexican/Chicano), James Luna (Native American - Luiseno), and Violeta Luna (Mexican). This multimedia performance/installation was conceived as a 'sampling of apocalyptic post-colonial nightmares for an imaginary photo shoot': on its two main platforms, Violeta Luna and James Luna perform warped versions of various 'fetishized identities' such as Frida Kahlo and a Native American shaman. Meanwhile, Peruvian artist Amapola Prada, donning an indigenous feather crown, lies naked on a dentist's chair as the audience intervenes on her body with text and objects. Gómez-Peña circulates around the space, serving as an instigator of audience participation in what he calls a 'performatic karaoke.' As the performance progresses, audience members draw on their own political/aesthetic sensibilities to create images on stage. These evoke a wide range of issues, such as the Vatican sex scandal, homophobia, alcoholism in Indian communities, homelessness and the Iraq war, among many others. This performance was presented at the Francisco Nunes theater in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, as a part of the 5th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, titled Performing Heritage: Contemporary Indigenous and Community-Based Practices (http://hemisphericinstitute.org/eng/seminar/brazil2005/index.html).

This performance brings together four contemporary American performances drawing from the artists' cultural roots: Quetzal Guerrero (Native American violinist and dancer), Larry Yazzie (Meskwaki/ Dine World Champion Fancy Dancer), David Pleasant (African-American Gullah/Geeche percussion and song, performing with dancer Joyah Pugh), and Dancing Earth (Indigenous Modern Dance collective directed by Rulan Tangen, with the participation of Quetzal Guerrero, Anthony Thosh Collins and Alejandro Meraz). Quetzal Guerrero and Thosh Collins open the evening with a traditional chant from the Salt River Pima-Maricopa indian community, followed by Quetzal's original solo violin piece. Larry Yazzie then performs his dazzling powwow Fancy Dance from Tama, Iowa, followed by the energetic and powerful percussion of African American David Pleasant, who draws on rhythms dating back to slavery in the United States. Dancing Earth performs a dance piece about the creation of the earth, and the evening ends with all performers bringing together their traditions--and the audience--on stage. There is also a post-performance discussion with the artists, in which they talk about the origins and meanings of their performances.

=520  \\$aMaskmaker, puppeteer and performance artist Deborah Hunt lives in Barrio San Mateo, in Santurce, part of the greater metropolitan area of San Juan, Puerto Rico. In 2005, one half of the barrio was expropriated by the Housing Department of Puerto Rico, and although in the early days there was talk of mixed income housing, etc., the move to clear the area of its long time residents to make way for luxury apartments and to 'revitalize' the area was an example of the greed and corrupt maneuvering of government, developers and the most important banking institute on the island. As part of the resistance to this sick undertaking, residents, artists and activists stopped machines, went to court and created murals and performance events. The Museo del Barrio was the focus of the effort. Using objects from the empty houses Deborah Hunt and her performance collaborators performed 'animas' in an abandoned 'zaguán.' The masks became a symbol for the people who had left, silent witnesses who later appeared on walls and protested in other public spaces. The area remained barren and empty. The few remaining trees had withered and died. They believe the area to be cursed. Deborah Hunt is a maskmaker, puppeteer and performance artist with 35 years experience in the creation and presentation of original theater and performance works. She has worked in New Zealand, USA, England, Mexico, Central America, Puerto Rico, British Windward Islands, Argentina, Denmark, Norway, Belgrade, Venezuela, Cuba, Spain, Singapore, Australia, and has been working bilingually (English/Spanish) since 1985. Hunt also teaches puppetry and maskwork, offering intensive laboratories lasting from a weekend to nine-months long. Born in New Zealand, residing in Puerto Rico since 1990, she is a member of the Magdalena Project and the Founder and Artistic Director of MASKHUNT Inc, theater of the futile.

It focuses particularly on the samba environment from the perspectives of two 'malandros' - Desabrigo and Cobrinha - and on the characters that surround their fight for the street territory and for the love of the prostitute Durvalina.

=520  \\$aPamyua is a musical ensemble from Alaska and Greenland that reinterprets modern traditions of the Inuit and Yup'ik people through storytelling, music and dance. Performing Yup'ik danced stories and harmonizing ancient and original music, their sound redefines the boundaries of Inuit expression. In this interview, conducted by Andrew McLean at the Hemispheric Institute 5th Encuentro (Belo Horizonte, 2005), Pamyua's four founding members (Stephen Blanchett, Phillip Blanchett, Ossie Kairaiuak and Karina Moeller) talk about their backgrounds, the origins of the band, and the ways their music blends traditional Yup'ik songs with African-American musical influences such as gospel, R&B, jazz and funk to create a unique new Native style. They speak of their experience as urban natives and their relationship to their roots, a relationship that for them has entailed a delicate process of cultural negotiation between different traditions and generations. Among other things, they discuss how they are viewed by the Yup'ik elders, what problems are facing their communities and how they are called upon as new culture bearers to revitalize Yup'ik identity among the youth.

=520  \\$aInterview with Marcos Malafaia, one of the directors of Brazilian puppet theater company Giramundo, conducted by Marcos Alexandre in the context of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics 5th Encuentro, Performing Heritage, celebrated in Belo Horizonte, Brazil in March of 2005. In this interview Malafaia discusses the origins and history of the group, their construction and manipulation techniques, and the influences and genres at play in Giramundos ongoing research, creation, performance and pedagogy. The artist also discusses the points of contact between arts and politics in the process of performing Brazilian heritage, paying special attention to four renowned plays by Giramundo: Tiradentes, O Guarani, Os Orixás, and Cobra Norato. Finally, Malafai comments on Giramundos latest spectacle, Pinocchio, an adaptation of Carlo Collodis text to puppet theater. Created in 1970 by Brazilian artists Álvaro Apocalypse, Terezinha Veloso and Maria do Carmo Vivacqua Martins (Madu), Giramundo Teatro de Bonecos (www.giramundo.org) has gained worldwide recognition as one of the most important puppet theater groups in the world. Their remarkable trajectory includes professional works for theater, film, video, and television, as well as a strong pedagogical component, teaching workshops and puppetry courses both abroad and in their own school in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. The 950 marionettes that they have already staged or that are still on stage are part of the Museu Giramundo collection, which has the largest private collection of the kind in Brazil. The methodological rigor in creating their performances, the refined construction and manipulation of their performing objects, and their interest in exploring topics in Brazilian culture have provided Giramundo with tools for transcending traditional childrens theater in order to incorporate adult themes and cultural forms in direct dialogue with complex political and aesthetic issues.

=520  \\$aShortly after the opening of his show, 'Revealing the Absent Indian,' part of the 'New Tribes New York' series at the National Museum of the American Indian, Alan Michelson talks about the exhibit, which is a retrospective of his work. Much of his art has been informed by the fact that his was adopted out (Native people were adopted out in alarming rates in the 1940's through the 1970's) and only met his Mohawk family later in life. Michelson frames this issue within the larger subject of Native displacement. Another theme of his work is the landscape, which the artist uses to challenge the notions of supremacy and superiority. One of the pieces Alan concentrates on, 'Two Row II,' is a video installation which references the Two Row Wampum Belt that symbolizes the agreement under which the Iroquois/Haudenosaunee (the Six nations confederacy which Mohawk are a part of) welcomed the white peoples to their lands: 'We will NOT be like father and son, but like brothers. These TWO ROWS will symbolize vessels, traveling down the same river together. One will be for the Original People, their laws, their customs, and the other for the European people and their laws and customs. We will each travel the river together, but each in our own boat. And neither of us will try to steer the other's vessel.' The Haudenosaunee has kept the agreement to this date. Alan's artwork is also in the film and his show can be seen at http://www.nmai.si.edu/exhibitions/newtribe/.

=520  \\$aHandheld footage of Coney Island's 2005 Circus Amok's show 'Princess: The Tail of a Lost City', a queer political performance on city planning and housing policy. The exploits of Bluetessa and Squeemish take us on a quest for affordable housing in NYC, in a legal/magical battle between President Bush's 2005 executive order on Eminent Domain and the civil society's proposal of the Tenant Empowerment Act. Issues of civic representation in governmental processes spark interactive audience participation, proposing 'candidates' for the Supreme Court and calling the Mayor's Office of Operations demanding mandatory inclusionary zoning. Trolls, felines, evil developers, jugglers and acrobats all come together to educate, activate and entertain, in a joyful extravaganza of acrobatic artistry, satiric skill, and good old-fashioned circus fun. Circus Amok (www.circusamok.org) is a New York City based circus-theater company whose mission is to provide free public art addressing contemporary issues of social justice to the people of New York City. Directed and founded by Jennifer Miller, the group has been together since 1989 bringing its funny, queer, caustic and sexy, political one-ring spectacles to diverse neighborhoods throughout the city. Over the years the traditional circus skills - tight rope walking, juggling, acrobatics, stilt walking, clowning - have been combined with experimental dance, lifesize puppetry, music old and new, and gender-bending performance art and improvisational techniques, creating new meanings for circus while continuing to entertain the crowds of all ages throughout the city streets, gardens, parks, and playgrounds, inviting the audience to join them in envisioning a more empowered life of community interaction while enjoying a queer celebratory spectacle.

=520  \\$aA Colombian mathematician, philosopher and politician, Antanas Mockus left his post as vice-chancellor of Colombian National University in Bogotá in 1993, and proceeded to preside over Bogotá as mayor for two eventful terms. His surprising and often humorous initiatives tended to involve grand gestures, often including local artists or personal appearances by the mayor himself - taking a shower in a commercial about conserving water, or walking the streets dressed in spandex and a cape as Supercitizen. Mockus hired 20 mimes to control traffic and poke fun at traffic violators - a program so successful that another 400 mimes were quickly trained. He also initiated a 'Night for Women,' on which the city's men were asked to stay home for an evening to look after the house and the children. The city sponsored free open-air concerts, bars offered women-only specials, and the city's women police were in charge of keeping the peace. Under his leadership, Bogotá saw remarkable improvement across the board - water usage dropped 40%, the homicide rate fell 70%, and traffic fatalities dropped by over 50%, to mention only a few. In this interview, conducted by Doris Sommer at the Hemispheric Institute's 5th Encuentro (Belo Horizonte, Brazil, 2005), Mockus plays a game with his interviewer: in a symbolic performance of 'social bonds,' they are linked to each other with string and must figure out how to disentangle themselves through movement (no cutting or untying), as they discuss civic culture and the ways conflict can be resolved through the plurality of art.

In this engaging keynote lecture at the Hemispheric Institute's 5th Encuentro (Belo Horizonte, Brazil, 2005), Mockus surveys the audience and lays out his definition of civic culture: the belief that people understand and comply with social norms 'por las buenas' (obeying their conscience, seeking social recognition, respecting the law) instead of 'por las malas' (fearing punishment, ostracism or guilt).

=520  \\$aGrupo Galpão was founded in 1982 in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil (north-west of Rio de Janeiro), and has come to be internationally renowned during its successful twenty-five year trajectory. 'An Imaginary Molière' is a musical based on Molière's 'The Imaginary Invalid,' and is performed using a mixture of styles that combine Brazilian popular culture with commedia dell'arte, circus performance and street theater. The play revolves around its main character, Argan, a greedy hypochondriac who is Molière's last great creation. Argan wants to marry his only daughter off to a weak and non-descript young man, just so he can have a doctor in his family. Against this background, the play investigates the nature and function of theater, while also paying hommage to one of the most important comedic playwrights of all time. This performance was presented at the Pálacio das Artes in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, as a part of the 5th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, titled Performing Heritage: Contemporary Indigenous and Community-Based Practices (http://hemisphericinstitute.org/eng/seminar/brazil2005/index.html).

Coordinator of Brazil's Programa Nacional do Patrimônio Imaterial (National Program for Intangible Cultural Heritage) of the Secretaria de Patrimônio, Museus e Artes Plásticas of the Brazilian Ministery of Culture, Ana specializes in research related to themes of intangible heritage, national borders, and indigenous etiology. Academic works include her dissertation O mundo transformado: Um estudo da Cultura de fronteira no Alto Rio Negro. In this keynote address, titled Safeguarding Cultural Heritage, delivered as a part of the Hemispheric Institute's 5th Encuentro (Belo Horizonte, Brazil, 2005 http://hemi.nyu.edu/eng/seminar/brazil2005), Gita discusses Brazil's current political and cultural climate related to the identification, inventory, documentation and registry of intangible cultural heritage. Focusing on the constitutional legislation Decreto 3551/2000 and the development of the Inventário Nacional de Referências Culturais (National Inventory of Cultural References), the anthropologist discusses the dialectic methodologies at play in the study of the local, regional and national contexts of Brazilian knowledges, practices and technologies, as well as the development of integrated policies related to the preservation of intangible cultural heritage.

=520  \\$aDavid Pleasant is a musical stylist who was raised in the Gullah/Geechee culture of Georgia (Sapelo Island, Darien/McIntosh County and Savannah). His work is driven by the wealth of African retention in Gullah culture, particularly juba, hand jive, pattin', rhappin' and shout, which have played a major role in the development of David's RiddimAthon!®, a performance and teaching method developed from a synthesis of African, Caribbean and African American musical traditions. As a Fulbright Senior Specialist, he presents international programs and lectures on the subject. His work has been featured in theater, dance and television, and he was featured in the award winning musical 'Crowns' by Regina Taylor. In this interview, conducted by Tavia Nyong'o at the Hemispheric Institute's 5th Encuentro (Belo Horizonte, Brazil, 2005), David talks about how he began playing percussion, demonstrates the rhythms he uses in his work, and how these shape daily Gullah life. These African-American beats include polyrhythm, call & response, pitched hand claps, syncopation, improvisation, concurrent percussion, and others that exist in much of American popular music. He also discusses 'Language of the Soul,' the show he had performed at the Encuentro a few days before the interview.

=520  \\$aDuring the first week of September 2005, the world watched the footage of Hurricane Katrina's New Orleans victims stranded on rooftops for days, crowded into the Convention Center and Superdome. Most of them were poor. Fulana asked themselves, What if the hurricane had hit a wealthy area instead? 'Operation Blue Blood' is a mock Confidential Message from the Bush Administration to the 'filthy rich fraction of American society,' reassuring them that in case of an emergency, the Top Secret Elite Rescue Armada would take care of them--in style. Fulana (www.fulana.org) is a Latina video collective from New York City. Through parody and satire, Fulana explores themes that are relevant to Latino cultures in the U.S., delving into the nuances that bind our experiences, experimenting with strategies to make visible what we're so often made to read between the lines. Their work, which consists mainly of mock television commercials, music videos and print advertisements, responds to the ways products and ideas are marketed to Latinos through the mass media.

=520  \\$aFarce performed by three 'bald grim reapers' rehearsing for a soirée in celebration of the Day of the Dead. The theme of the 'rehearsal' is hair, legends of the long hair of ancestral feminine characters like Medusa, Lady Godiva, Mary Magdalene, among others. The piece questions the tradition of patriarchal thought which depicts women's bodies as incarnations of evil; with the complicit help of science, religion, law, art and marketing, the symbolic damnation of women has been perpetuated, reinforced by new, contemporary myths. The ambivalent depiction of the feminine throughout history - as a muse, an object, a mother, a temptress, an angel, a witch - positions the feminine in a paradoxical crossroads of misogyny and idealization, rendering women a disempowered 'Other'. The piece poses a feminist commentary on these misogynist practices, using a meta-theatrical approach to the stories of famous feminine icons to denounce the injustices inflicted on them, and to celebrate their power and agency as women. La Máscara is the oldest feminist, all-women's theater in Colombia. Founded in 1972 in Cali, La Máscara was a political theater initially comprised of male and female actors; by the early 1980s, when only the women wanted to continue its theatrical trajectory, Lucy Bolaños decided to make La Máscara a women's ensemble fully dedicated to a feminine dramaturgy on gender issues. Committed to feminism and social change, they have stayed true to this mission, despite the many social and economic pressures they've had to endure in an environment plagued by violence and machismo, which constantly seeks to 'invisibilize' their work. They're not only creating and staging plays, but also working with marginalized communities, actively participating in political protests, and being involved in the organization of theater festivals. Through their work, they keep re-thinking women's role in the construction of a peaceful Colombia.

Interviews with La Máscara's founder and director Lucy Bolaños, playwright Pilar Restrepo, and spokesperson of the 'Red Nacional de Mujeres' Norma Bermúdez give context to the contributions of La Máscara to the development and acknowledgment of Colombian women's creative languages, while advocating for a culture of peace through the strengthening of alternative imaginaries of solidarity and equality. Teatro La Máscara is the oldest - and one of the only - feminist, all-women's theater in Colombia. Founded in 1972 in Cali, La Máscara was a political theater initially comprised of male as well as female actors; by the early 1980s, when only the women stayed and wanted to continue the theatrical trajectory of the group, Lucy Bolaños decided to make La Máscara a women's ensemble fully dedicated to a feminine dramaturgy on gender issues. Committed to feminism and social change, they have stayed true to this mission, despite the many social and economic pressures they've had to endure in an environment plagued by violence and machismo, which constantly seeks to 'invisibilize' their work. Because of their fruitful stubbornness, La Máscara is not only creating and staging plays, but also working with marginalized communities, actively participating in political protests and demonstrations, and being involved in the organization of theater festivals. Through their work, they keep re-thinking women's role in the construction of a peaceful Colombia.

=520  \\$aCabaret event by renowned artists Jesusa Rodríguez and Liliana Felipe, a farewell gathering celebrating the 15-year trajectory of their Teatro Bar El Hábito. The legendary performance venue was originally opened in 1954 by Mexican poet Salvador Novo as an agora for artistic expression. Acquired and ran by Rodríguez and Felipe since 1990, El Hábito was transformed into a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. Singing well-known songs by Felipe, reminiscing about events of the past 15 years, and 'passing the torch' to the new owners of the performance space (the theater-cabaret ensemble Reinas Chulas - Ana Francis Mor, Cecilia Sotres, Marisol Gasé, and Nora Huerta), Jesusa and Liliana celebrate the closing of a period of their fruitful trajectory together, leaving us with a provocative aphorism: 'lo más difícil de quitarse es un hábito'. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodréguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a 'chameleon,' Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her 'espectáculos' (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and 'carpa,' to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguez's energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: 'I am going to die with that woman.' Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. In this off-off space, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas, Jesusa y Liliana have produced hundreds of shows since the 1980s.

=520  \\$a'Prehispanic Cabaret' is an act of protest against multinational agricultural biotechnology corporations (such as Monsanto) whose introduction of genetically-modified corn into Mexican agriculture severely threatens the country's intangible cultural heritage by all but eliminating natural corn. 'We are corn people,' says writer, director and performer Jesusa Rodríguez, who has been politically active in in the uphill battle against the government-backed corporations. This cabaret, unlike most of Jesusa and Liliana's work at El Hábito, is largely non-verbal; it is Liliana's mordant lyrics that give voice to Jesusa's symbolic body onstage as she becomes an indigenous woman, a character in a codex, a peasant, and finally the figure of Death. 'Cabaret Prehispánico' was performed at the Francisco Nunes theater in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, as a part of the 5th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, titled Performing Heritage: Contemporary Indigenous and Community-Based Practices (http://hemisphericinstitute.org/eng/seminar/brazil2005/index.html).. The performance is followed by a Q&A session, where Jesusa tells the audience that the Death character, besides throwing handfuls of corn up into the air and onto the stage, was also supposed to throw (fake) hundred-dollar bills--except they were stolen at the airport. Jesusa also reveals that this show (performed only once before, in New York) marks the end of their 15-year trajectory at El Hábito. 'There is an abyss behind us and an abyss before us, and we need to take a break to think about where we go from here,' she says.

=520  \\$a'YokastaS Redux' portrays the mother of Oedipus at four different stages of her life, played by four different actresses. Breaking Yokasta into multiple characters enabled Schechner and Stanescu to reconfigure the story as a plural narrative of conflicting desires and life experiences. The multi-faceted work combines irony, tragedy, humor, sexuality, murder, and pop culture. Yoyo, a prepubescent girl is determined and hopeful as she insists she will not live the life fated for her. Yoko, is first seen on the night she abandons Oedipus and last seen on the night before Laius leaves for his last journey to Delphi. Bitter and angry, Yoko seeks vengeance for her ruined life. Yono welcomes youthful, lusty Oedipus back to Thebes, marries him, bears four children, and trains him to be king. She also describes how, before Oedipus re-entered her life, she drowned her boy newborns. Finally, Yokasta, around 55, a sage and sharp-witted cynic, tours talk shows to denounce the 'lies' that Sophocles and Freud wrote about her. Laius-Oedipus-Talk Show Host is foil, partner, lover, son, and father. In one talk show scene the Yokastas, representing Yokasta, Medea, and Phaedra, argue over who is 'tragedy's baddest mama.' The multiple Yokastas share the stage interacting and disagreeing with each other and, finally, with the audience. Richard Schechner is a theater director, performance theorist and university professor known for being one of the founders of the academic discipline of Performance Studies at Tisch School of the Arts, New York University. Schechner combines his work in anthropology with innovative approaches to performance of all kinds including ritual, drama, environmental theatre, political rallies, dance, music, etc. in order to consider how performance can be understood not just as an object of study, but also as an active intellectual-artistic practice. He is the editor of 'TDR: The Journal of Performance Studies.' His books include 'Environmental Theater,' 'The Future of Ritual,' 'Performance Theory,' 'Between Theater and Anthropology' and 'Performance Studies: An Introduction.' As of 2007, his books have been translated into 14 languages.

=520  \\$aVicky Holt Takamine is the founder and kumu hula (master teacher) of Pua Ali'i 'Ilima, a school of traditional Hawaiian dance. In addition, she teaches hula at UH Mānoa and Leeward Community College. She graduated through the 'ūniki rituals of hula from Maiki Aiu Lake. Vicky received her BA and MA in Dance Ethnology from the University of Hawai'i. She is well respected throughout the Hawaiian community for her cultural expertise and advocacy work on behalf of Hawaiians, their cultural traditions, and the protection and preservation of the cultural and natural resources of Hawai'i. In 1997, Vicky coordinated a massive demonstration of Hawaiian cultural practitioners to oppose legislation that would severely restrict native Hawaiian cultural practices. Since then, she has coordinated demonstrations, rallies and marches calling for social, economic and environmental justice for native Hawaiians. Vicky is the po'o (president) and co-founder of 'Īlio'ulaokalani (www.ilio.org), a coalition of traditional practitioners who are committed to protecting their Hawaiian customs and traditions, the president of KAHEA: The Hawaiian Environmental Alliance, a coalition of Hawaiian and Environmental organizations committed to protecting the natural and cultural environment of Hawai'i, and co-founder and president of Aloha 'Aina, a new Hawaiian political party. In this interview, conducted at the Hemispheric Institute's 5th Encuentro (Belo Horizonte, Brazil, 2005, http://hemi.nyu.edu/eng/seminar/brazil2005), Takamine talks about how hula dance has served as a tool for transmission of native Hawaiian traditions, as a mode of resistance against colonialism, and as a site for the discussion of issues of intangible cultural heritage.

=520  \\$aDancing Earth is an array of indigenous dance artists who work as a collective under the leadership of Rulan Tangen, striving to embody a unique essence of Indigenous identity and perspective by creation and renewal of artistic and cultural movement rituals. 'Ancient and futuristic, our dances are an elemental language of bone and blood memory in motion. We cultivate our individual artistry on behalf of empowerment of all peoples, and create bridges for art and humanity, tradition and experimentation. Through movement, we gather with respect, inspiration and innovation. We create our works with Indigenous collaborators in the fields of music, mask making, photography, costume, light design, architecture, poetry and storytelling.' In this interview, conducted by Tina Majkowski at the Hemispheric Institute's 5th Encuentro (Belo Horizonte, Brazil, 2005), choreographer Rulan Tangen is joined by musician/dancer/painter Quetzal Guerrero (Cambiva, Yacqui, Ahumeche), dancer/photographer Anthony Ch-Wl-Tas Collins (Salt River Pima, Seneca, Osage), and dancer/actor/painter Alejandro Meraz (Tarasco). They discuss, among other things, the origins of their collaboration, the role of dance as a channel of empowerment for indigenous people, and the ways in which Dancing Earth works with memory, place, tradition, and ritual through movement.

=520  \\$aDrew Hayden Taylor (www.drewhaydentaylor.com) is an Ojibwa author, humorist and playwright from Curve Lake Reserve Ontario, Canada. In this interview, Taylor talks about his use of humor, the way he feels about using Native issues in his work, and they way his work is received in different communities. He also addresses writing from an Aboriginal perspective for a broader non-Native audience. By analyzing the use of Native humor in his pieces, he breaks down the universal language of his plays. Within the larger context of Aboriginal Theater, Drew looks at the development of his works as an offshoot of the work of people such as Thompson Highway and feels that he is able to go beyond the early works in this area that are primarily dark and depressing. Finally, Taylor rhapsodizes about the future of Native Theater and the translation of the classics such as Chekhov into Aboriginal settings.

=520  \\$aAlina Troyano (a.k.a.Carmelita Tropicana) is a Cuban-born performance artist, playwright, and actor who has presented work internationally, from el Museo del Barrio in NYC to Hebbel am Ufer in Berlin. Her book, ‘I, Carmelita Tropicana: Performing Between Cultures’ includes plays, monologues, performance art pieces, and short stories. In Tropicana’s work humor and fantasy become subversive tools to rewrite history. Tropicana’s performances plays and videos have been presented at venues such as the Institute of Contemporary Art in London, Hebbel Am Ufer in Berlin, Centre de Cultura Contemporanea in Barcelona, the Berlin International Film Festival, the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York, the Mark Taper Forum’s Kirk Douglas Theater in Los Angeles, and El Museo del Barrio in New York. She has received numerous awards including the prestigious Anonymous Was a Woman and fellowships from the New York Foundation for the Arts as well as an Obie for Sustained Excellence in Performance.
=520  \\$aThis is a video documentation of a performance by/for an intimate audience, marked by conversational and relational interactions. ‘Cry a la Jack’ is a performance/homage to queer experimental filmmaker Jack Smith. Carmelita Tropicana explains to the audience how she became a performance artist, and she offers her ‘performance art manifesto’ and her definition of performance art: ‘Performance art just changes your perception. Objects that you thought are no longer the same objects.’ Bringing together the body and life and death, she remembers Jack Smith’s presence everywhere, and thanks him for making her "the ‘thesbian’ that I am today." Remembering that Jack prompted her to cry on stage, she cuts an onion to provoke tears. She asks audience members to take a whiff of the onion and asks what would they cry about. She finally burst into song remembering Jack and, in doing so, bringing his presence close to her: ‘You light up my days and fill my life with sun...it can’t be wrong when it feels so right...you, you, you, Jack, light up my life.’

The leader discusses the hardships endured by his people, as well as their efforts to safeguard their particular cultural heritage and practices in the face of political pressures to integrate them into a homogeneous, uniform Brazilian culture. Speaking mainly in his native Kaiapó language, he is introduced by fellow native leader Ailton Krenak, creator and director of the Centro de Pesquisa Indígena and Núcleo de Direitos Indígenas (Native Research Centre and Centre of Native Rights) and translated into Portuguese by Terence Turner, Professor of Anthropology at Cornell University who has worked with the Kayapó of Central Brazil since 1962.

=520  \\$a'La razón blindada' is based on the classic novel 'El Quijote' by Miguel de Cervantes, Franz Kafka's 'The Truth about Sancho Panza,' and testimonies by Chicho Vargas and other political prisoners held in the 1970's at the Rawson Prison during Argentina's dictatorship. In the play, two political prisoners, oppressed by physical and emotional abuse, find solace in meeting every Sunday at dusk to tell the story of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. Their storytelling unravels amidst the extreme limitations imposed by their condition of inmates in a maximum security prison. It is fueled by the vital need to tell each other a story that could save them, that could transport them to a human adventure situated in the realm of imagination, where hardship and fear can't reach them, where the most intense pain can be mitigated by the act of imagining a different reality. In this way, they continuously reinvent Don Quixote, the knight-errant who constantly takes windmills for giants, withered women for maidens, and prisons for paradises, a character who exiles himself in insanity, that strange state of harmless straggle, an oblique strategy for survival. The Grupo de Teatro Malayerba (teatromalayerba.org) was founded in Quito in 1979 by Arístides Vargas, Susana Pautasso and María del Rosario 'Charo' Francés, immigrant actors originally from Argentina and Spain. From the start, Malayerba included actors with various backgrounds and nationalities, invested in the exploration of the rich cultural diversity and complex history of Ecuador, as well as issues of migration, exile, political violence and individual and collective memory. With over 25 years of ongoing theater practice and more than 20 plays performed locally and internationally for a diverse audience, Malayerba is committed to theater pedagogy and experimentation, artistic collaboration, and community building. They have represented Ecuador in national and international theater festivals; they have also collaborated with theater groups within Ecuador and in other countries, and performed for both film and television, while engaging in community work in Quito. In 1989 the group created the Laboratorio Malayerba, committed to the training of generations of young Ecuadorian actors and to an ongoing investigation of theories and practices of experimental theater. In 2001 Malayerba launched the theater journal 'Hoja de Teatro,' conceived as a forum for the theorization, criticism and dissemination of Ecuadorian theater practices. The group also runs a theater house, the Casa Malayerba, which houses the Laboratory as well as a theater with seating capacity for seventy people. Malayerba approaches theater making as an artistic, ethical and technical realm where to engage in meaningful creative experiences through which to understand, assume and confront current sociopolitical processes. In working together, actors with various backgrounds and nationalities have shown that a multicultural blend is not only possible but also enriching, as differences lead to new identities, embodiments of dreams, memories, absences and pains that are at once local and universal.

=520  \\$aIn this rendition of the classic Greek tragedy, La Candelaria addresses once again the horrors of political and social violence in Colombian society. When Patricia Ariza visited Urabá, a region in Colombia, she talked to a group of women who could not bury their dead husbands, killed in the civil war. She connected this awful situation to the myth of Antigone and read it to the collective. This version of La Candelaria involves a series of transformations to the original myth. At the beginning, we see Tiresias walking around an empty space; taking the place of the chorus, he gives the audience the historical context, recounting background events that are important for a proper understanding of the play. The play presents three Antigones and two Ismenes who discuss the possibility of violating Creonte's rules in order to bury their brothers according to tradition. The discussion is thus polyphonic. La Candelaria was founded in 1966 by a group of independent artists and intellectuals who came from experimental theater and the broader Colombian cultural movement. Directed by Santiago García, La Candelaria (www.teatrolacandelaria.org.co) is one of Colombian theater's most innovative agents, modernizing national drama while addressing popular audiences. By means of an ongoing exploration of national folklore, situations and characters, they have created some of Colombia's most compelling plays, some of them through the method of 'creación colectiva' ('collective creation'), addressing the acute social and political problems of their society. At the same time, they fostered the creation of Corporación Colombiana del Teatro and have developed a number of theoretical works that reflect upon dramatic creation, its methods and languages. Still nowadays, La Candelaria is committed to repertoire, experimentation, and discussion as fundamental elements to artistic creation.

=520  \\$a'Betsy' is an intercultural music play marking 10 years of partnership with the Appalachian artists of Roadside Theater (www.roadside.org). The story involves a Bronx born and bred Puerto Rican jazz singer who stirs up the little known history of her Scot-Irish ancestry. The production's musical team includes Nashville jazz legend Beegie Adair, Old Time master Ron Short, and Puerto Rican composer/pianist Desmar Guevara. Directors Dudley Cocke and Rosalba Rolón also share writing credits. 'Betsy' was previewed at the New Pregones Theater in May 2006. Here documented is the performance filmed by Bronxnet as a part of its '¡Bronxlive!' series. Founded in 1979 and based in The Bronx, New York City, Pregones Theater (http://www.pregones.org) has performed in more than 400 cities and 13 countries. The company enjoys citywide recognition for their lasting contributions to the performing arts field and are recipients of numerous distinctions including current Leading National Ensemble Theatre Designation from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Primary Cultural Institution Designation from the New York State Council on the Arts, the New York State Governor's Arts Award, the Culture & Humanities Award from the Center for Puerto Rican Studies, numerous artist and production awards, as well as invitations to appear at international festivals and events. Over the years Pregones has developed a style that combines theater, music and movement, oral and written traditions, and a signature urban sensibility. The ensemble draws from popular Puerto Rican artistic expressions and literature to create and stage its work. Today, Pregones has grown to be one of the leading Puerto Rican/Latino theater theaters in the United States. From migrations to indigenous mythologies to subway stories, the company's repertoire covers a growing sample of Latino experiences and identities.

=520  \\$aElvira and Hortencia Colorado, Chichimec Otomi storytellers, playwrights, performers and community activists, are founding members of Coatlicue Theatre Company. Recipients of the Ingrid Washinawatok Community Activism Award, they are also members of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, Danza Celtiliztli Nauhcampa, the New York Zapatistas and the American Indian Community House. The company's plays and workshops address social, political, cultural and identity issues that impact their lives and their community. Coatlicue's work is based on stories they weave together, educating as well as entertaining while reaffirming their survival as urban Native American women. 'Holding Up the Sky' is a series of theater skits addressing issues of borders and immigration at work in indigenous communities, ranging from the grotesque to the poignant, from the deeply personal to global issues devastating their communities. Distinctive elements of this performance are the use of humor in storytelling and the participation of audience members to 'hold up the sky' as inspired by Mayan mythology. Muriel Miguel (Spiderwoman Theater) contextualizes this event by talking about Coatlicue's long relationship with the American Indian Community House (www.aich.org), and the fact that this 'Indian Summer' is the last series of performances at The Circle in the AICH's current location.

=520  \\$aSusana Cook (www.susanacook.com) is a New York-based Argentinean theater and performance artist. Mainly directed to queer and Latino communities in New York City, Cook's work also encompasses a heated response to broader State policies that oppress communities defined in the intersection of race, gender, and class. In her shows, Cook parodies discourses of power, drawing attention to the close ties between the state, religious and political conservatism, and the military. Cook's plays usually feature all-women casts that defy the normative performance of gender, race, and sexuality. 'The Idiot King' was presented at WOW Café and at Dixon Place a week before the Senate of the United States discussed an amendment to the Constitution that would ban the marriage of gay and lesbian couples. The amendment didn't pass, but some conservative Republicans announced that they will restart the discussion after a month. 'The Idiot King' is about the Sanctity of Marriage and policy making. In the play the Idiot King and his Court discuss several issues affecting the world like Satan, global warming, the sanctity of marriage, abortion, and evil. The discussions are embedded within Christian religiosity, biased logic, and irony. The parody includes real quotes from some of the ruling discourse, making it difficult to tell them apart from the jokes.

=520  \\$aDedicated to 'all the power of the Un-massacre of Art and to the effects of the Trans-Human power of the Crowd,' the staging of the last part of the book deals with the fourth and last expedition by the Brazilian National Army to the Northeastern 'sertão.' 12 thousand soldiers, cannons, and modern weapons where deployed, together with modern strategists such as Marshal Bittencourt who, for the first time in the history of the Brazilian Army, established an operational base away from the front, from where he commanded the maneuvers that General Arthur Oscar and his deputy, the blood-thirsty General Barbosa, executed. The play shows the end of the War of Canudos, which resulted in the massacre of the sertanejos, the death of Antônio Conselheiro himself (who went to meet God), and the destruction of the citadel. In Teatro Oficina, the massacre is performed not as a mass for the repetition of the martyrdom, but from the perspective of an un-massacre. By exposing this closed abscess of Brazilian History in the Public Square of Theater, it wishes to lance it once and for all, to purge it from the everyday practice of Brazilian life. Canudos did not surrender, and Euclides da Cunha ends his book by reminding us that it is not one of defense, but of attack.
=520  \\$aFrom 2000 to 2007, Teat(r)o Oficina Uzyna Uzona worked on the staging of Euclides da Cunha's epic book, Os Sertões, which describes the 19th Century War of Canudos in the Brazilian 'sertão,' lead by Antônio Conselheiro. The final result was a pentalogy, formed by the plays A Terra (2002), O Homem I (2003), O Homem II (2003), A Luta I (2005), and A Luta II (2006), totalizing 27 hours of theater. Os Sertões reads the episodes of the war in light of past and present Brazilian history, and in relation to the struggle of the group against media mogul Sílvio Santos, who wanted to tear down the historic theater.

=520  \\$aFOMMA - Fortaleza de la Mujer Maya - is a collective of Mayan women who use theater as a tool for education and community building. Based in San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico, they are performers, playwrights, and teachers who tour their work in their communities and internationally, performing plays that focus on women's and indigenous rights, literacy, cultural survival, ecology, health, and education in the Tzeltal and Tzotzil indigenous languages. 'El Dueño de las Mariposas' tells the story of Chepe, an orphan predestined by his 'wayjel' - the hummingbird - to change the fate of the slaves suffering under the despotic rule of coffee plantation landowner Don Martín Contreras. The play exposes the dreadful life and work conditions of the 'cafetaleros' (coffee plantation workers), denouncing human right violations and demanding the observance of the fundamental rights of the individual. This piece is the result of a process of collective creation on the relationship between politics and the body; the resulting performance brings together symbols, characters and circumstances form the rich Mayan imaginary as well as from the everyday life conditions of indigenous peoples in Latin America, in intricate labyrinths of time, love, injustice, and freedom, an urgent call for inalienable human rights.

=511  1\$aDawn Dumont.
=520  \\$aComedian and actress Dawn Dumont has performed at comedy clubs across North America including the New York's Comic Strip, New York Comedy Club and the Improv. She began her comedy career in Canada on stages such as Yuk Yuks and the Laugh Resort. Dawn is also a comedy writer and has written for the stage, radio, film and television; her work has been featured on APTN's Buffalo Tracks and CBC Radio. Dumont's comedy style has been described as a coy smile covering a killer wit. Dawn is a Plains Cree born and raised in Saskatchewan, Canada; her reserve, the Okanese First Nation, is quite possibly the smallest reservation in the world. This is her first time performing at the American Indian Community House (www.aich.org). She tells 'anecdotes' from her home reservation in Saskatchewan and her recent move to New York, joking about common problems Native people face in the city, such as being mistaken for other races. Dawn Dumont's humor is representative of the way in which Native people utilize humor as a coping mechanism and a tool for political commentary.

=520  \\$aIn this interview, filmmaker Chris Eyre (www.chriseyre.org) talks about the reasons why he went into filmmaking, his early years as a filmmaker at NYU, and the influence he felt this educational foundation had on his work. Chris also reminisces about his early career, at a time when independent film was still a force in the media world, and the burgeoning Native film community that sprung up during this period. The discussion leads to Eyre's landmark film 'Smoke Signals' and the direction the success of the film took him personally and professionally. The success of this film lead the artist to a feeling of greater responsibility to represent and to gain knowledge about other tribes since he became an involuntary spokesperson for Native people. As a filmmaker at the beginning of his career, interviewer Andrew McLean (Inupik) directed several questions to Eyre about negotiating the film world as a minority producer. Chris acknowledged the existing pressures to be 'issue oriented' and stated that the fact that a Native person was on film makes it a political piece. Eyre reflects on some of his films such as 'Skins' (which he made to illustrate the poverty on the Pine Ridge reservation, and consequently did not have a successful run), and contrasted it with his character-driven films such as 'Smoke Signals' and 'Edge of America,' which have a more universal appeal. Finally Chris relays Andrew, who come form a whaling Nation, his excitement about an upcoming project on the Makah Whale hunt that took place in May 17, 1999 at Neah Bay.

=520  \\$aTeresa Hernández is a Puerto Rican stage artist. Since 1987 she has written, directed and performed contemporary theater and dance, both in Puerto Rico's commercial and experimental art scenes. Along with choreographer Viveca Vázquez, she directs and administers the Taller de Otra Cosa, Inc., a nonprofit organization committed to the development and production of experimental dance and performance projects. As a solo artist, she produces her work since 1991 through her organization Producciones Teresa, no Inc.. She also offers workshops, talks and performance demonstrations for high school and college students. Teresa's creative projects are characterized by a consistent eschewing of traditional artistic categories. Theater, dance, performance, dramatic text, movement, costumes, video and everyday objects are juxtaposed and confronted, placed in a liminal space where notions of precariousness are explored and celebrated. Teresa's characters explore and expose the anxieties of everyday life in Puerto Rican society, transversally investigating issues of gender, class and race. In this interview, the artist talks about her coined term 'stage artist' (vis-à-vis 'perfomer', 'actress' or 'dancer') in the light of her multifaceted training and artistic trajectory. Teresa explains the role of the 'taller' (workshop) as a format and context for artistic creation. She talks about approximation, appropriation and precariousness as organizing coordinates of her artistic work. Hernández also discusses the creation and transformation of her characters, the use of costumes and everyday objects as stimuli for creation, the exploits of being an experimental artist in Puerto Rico, and her (at the time of the interview) upcoming project 'Nada Que Ver (Composiciones Escénicas Sobre el Yo)'.

=520  \\$a'Nada que ver (composiciones escénicas sobre el yo)' is a multimedia one-woman piece created and performed by Teresa Hernández exploring the theme of Self. Seduced by the contradictions at play in the impossibility of speaking of 'self' without referencing an 'other,' the artist performs seven skits (divided in two acts, 'Post-infarto' and 'Parada') combining monologues, experimental dance, and video, as a sort of autobiography-in-flux, an exercise that questions even the very process of autobiographical introspection. In the piece, the grammatical first person (common in autobiography) blends with the third person, in a masquerade of characters through which chameleonic Hernández presents the hard lessons of what it entails, in this day and age, to be an experimental stage artist in Puerto Rico. Teresa Hernández is a Puerto Rican stage artist. Since 1987 she has written, directed and performed contemporary theater and dance, both in Puerto Rico's commercial and experimental art scenes. Teresa's creative projects are characterized by a consistent eschewing of traditional artistic categories.

Ongoing artistic collaborators include Gilda Navarra and Antonio Martorell (Puerto Rico), Grupo Malayerba (Ecuador), Grupo Yuyachkani (Peru), and directors Peter Shumann (Bread & Puppet Theater, U.S.A.) and Augusto Boal (Theater of the Oppressed, Brazil). This video documents the theater piece 'La razón blindada,' written by Argentinean playwright Arístides Vargas and directed in Puerto Rico by Márquez, as a part of her ongoing artistic collaboration with Ecuadorean theater collective Malayerba (of which Vargas is director and founding member). Inspired by the 400th anniversary of the publication of Cervantes' 'El Quijote,' by Kafka's writings on Quixote and Sancho, and by the strategies of survival of political prisoners during Argentina's Dirty War (more specifically, the actual experiences of Vargas' brother, Chicho), 'La razón' is a piece about imprisonment, madness, storytelling and solidarity. In this staging by Márquez, the text is adapted to the Puerto Rican reality, exploring issues of political imprisonment that links pervasive Latin American political atrocities to selective profiling, political persecution, and the complex colonial condition of Puerto Rico.

=520  \\$a'El bolero fue mi ruina' ('The Bolero Was My Downfall') is an acclaimed adaptation of Manuel Ramos Otero's 'Loca la de la locura.' The play's protagonist is an aging transvestite fulfilling the last days of a long prison sentence for murder. The production deploys the aesthetics of torch song and kitsch to convey a subtler message about love, abuse, and the relationship between perpetrator and victim. Since its premiere in 1997, 'El bolero' has been performed throughout the U.S., and in Puerto Rico, Peru, Mexico, and France. New sets and costumes were introduced for the Spring 2006 run at the New Pregones Theater. The performance is dedicated to all who continue to devote their life to advancing the struggles for equality, inclusion and justice, and most significantly, to the legacy of Silvia Rivera - a true crusader and pioneer of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender civil rights movement in the US. Silvia was one of a group of drag queens who fought police during a raid on the Stonewall Inn on Christopher Street in 1969, an event that sparked the gay rights movement in NYC. She died on February 19, 2002, of liver cancer, at the age of 50. Founded in 1979 and based in The Bronx, New York City, Pregones Theater (http://www.pregones.org) has performed in more than 400 cities and 13 countries. The company enjoys citywide recognition for their lasting contributions to the performing arts field and are recipients of numerous distinctions including current Leading National Ensemble Theatre Designation from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Primary Cultural Institution Designation from the New York State Council on the Arts, the New York State Governor's Arts Award, the Culture & Humanities Award from the Center for Puerto Rican Studies, numerous artist and production awards, as well as invitations to appear at international festivals and events. Over the years Pregones has developed a style that combines theater, music and movement, oral and written traditions, and a signature urban sensibility. The ensemble draws from popular Puerto Rican artistic expressions and literature to create and stage its work. Today, Pregones has grown to be one of the leading Puerto Rican/Latino theater theaters in the United States. From migrations to indigenous mythologies to subway stories, the company's repertoire covers a growing sample of Latino experiences and identities.

=520  \\$aSpiderwoman Theater is the longest continuous running Native female performance group in North America. Comprised of three Kuna/Rappahannock sisters from Brooklyn, NY (Lisa Mayo, Gloria Miguel and Muriel Miguel), the group has traveled all over the world sharing performances, lectures, and workshops. Named after the Hopi goddess Spiderwoman, who taught the people to weave, the sisters write and perform stories through what they call 'storyweaving', their technique of creating storytelling theatrical pieces through text, movement, music, visual images, and song. As a part of Indian Summer 2006 in The Circle, Spiderwoman performs one-woman works by Gloria Miguel, Lisa Mayo, and Muriel Miguel (respectively), as well as storyweaving material developed as an ensemble. This was one of the last performances to be held at the renowned AICH venue at 404 Lafayette, and therefore an emotional piece and an homage to the long and fruitful relationship between Spiderwoman Theater and the American Indian Community House (www.aich.org).

=520  \\$aInterview with performance artist Jennifer Miller, director of New York's troupe Circus Amok (www.circusamok.org), conducted by Mila Aponte-González for the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics (www.hemisphericinstitute.org). In this interview, Miller talks about the origins, adventures and exploits of Circus Amok, commenting on the troupe's training, the politics and aesthetics of street performance, their experiences as political and queer performers in and for New York City communities, some recurrent topics in their work, and how their aesthetic influences and creative methods juggle between performance and politics in a collaborative atmosphere. Circus Amok is a New York City based circus-theater company whose mission is to provide free public art addressing contemporary issues of social justice to the people of New York City. Directed and founded by Miller, the group has been together since 1989 bringing its funny, queer, caustic and sexy, political one-ring spectacles to diverse neighborhoods throughout the city. Over the years the traditional circus skills - tight rope walking, juggling, acrobatics, stilt walking, clowning - have been combined with experimental dance, lifesize puppetry, music old and new, and gender-bending performance art and improvisational techniques, creating new meanings for circus while continuing to entertain the crowds of all ages throughout the city streets, gardens, parks, and playgrounds, inviting the audience to join them in envisioning a more empowered life of community interaction while enjoying a queer celebratory spectacle.

=520  \\$aIn this interview, Soni Moreno (Mayan/Apache/Yaqui) reflects on her earlier years as a performer, arriving in New York City, and finding the American Indian Community House (AICH). During this time she also met her singing partner, Pura Fe (Tuscarora), and started the group Ulali (www.ulali.com). She reminisces about all the performances she has seen and participated in during her years at the AICH, including prestigious performers such as jazz musician Jim Pepper (Kaw) and rock star Robbie Robbertson (Mohawk). She talks about the different projects that have taken place at the AICH, ranging from comedy to drama to dance in the gallery and in the Circle. Soni has taken part in several collaborations over the years, and recalls working on the 'Vagina Monologues' and the 'L Word' soundtrack with Matou, the Moari Native American group with which she is currently performing.

=520  \\$a'Bicicleta Lerux' presents the life of Ulises, a domestic Ulysses who never leaves home and whose travels are limited to wandering between the living room, the kitchen and the bathroom, in a personal Odyssey of memory. Penelope, in the meantime, unravels Ulises' journey, revealing an intimate life full of absences. The voyage is triggered by Lerux - a person? a place? an idea? - which stirs Ulises' deepest feelings and emotions. 'Bicicleta Lerux' was inspired by the powerful motif of Ulysses' Odyssey. While not intending to recreate the classic Greek myth, the play explores the human aspects of this quest, turning a mythical voyage into an everyday human experience, mapping out the 'geography' of a person's life - the chasms of tragedies endured, the distant, gentle slopes of happiness enjoyed. The Grupo de Teatro Malayerba (teatromalayerba.org) was founded in Quito in 1979 by Arístides Vargas, Susana Pautasso and María del Rosario 'Charo' Francés, immigrant actors originally from Argentina and Spain. From the start, Malayerba included actors with various backgrounds and nationalities, invested in the exploration of the rich cultural diversity and complex history of Ecuador, as well as issues of migration, exile, political violence and individual and collective memory. With over 25 years of ongoing theater practice and more than 20 plays performed locally and internationally for a diverse audience, Malayerba is committed to theater pedagogy and experimentation, artistic collaboration, and community building. They have represented Ecuador in national and international theater festivals; they have also collaborated with theater groups within Ecuador and in other countries, and performed for both film and television, while engaging in community work in Quito. In 1989 the group created the Laboratorio Malayerba, committed to the training of generations of young Ecuadorian actors and to an ongoing investigation of theories and practices of experimental theater. In 2001 Malayerba launched the theater journal 'Hoja de Teatro,' conceived as a forum for the theorization, criticism and dissemination of Ecuadorian theater practices. The group also runs a theater house, the Casa Malayerba, which houses the Laboratory as well as a theater with seating capacity for seventy people. Malayerba approaches theater making as an artistic, ethical and technical realm where to engage in meaningful creative experiences through which to understand, assume and confront current sociopolitical processes. In working together, actors with various backgrounds and nationalities have shown that a multicultural blend is not only possible but also enriching, as differences lead to new identities, embodiments of dreams, memories, absences and pains that are at once local and universal.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of Puerto Rican experimental dance performance ‘mAroma,’ choreographed by Viveca Vázquez, who is a choreographer, dancer, and a professor of humanities and contemporary dance for actors at the University of Puerto Rico. She presented her first work with Pisotón, the first experimental dance group of Puerto Rico and, shortly after, Taller de Otra Cosa, of which she became the first director. Through the company she presented her choreographic work and produced events such as ‘Rompeforma’ a key festival in the development of the experimental dance and performance scene in Puerto Rico, which was co-produced with Puerto Rican choreographer based in the U.S. Merian Soto. Since 1984 she has produced and performed experimental dance works in the United States, Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina, among a great number of other places. As a teacher she has developed a pedagogical model based on body conscience and improvisation.
=520  \\$a‘mAroma’ is a stage adaptation based on Virgil’s The Aeneid, Pasolini’s Mamma Roma, and Tollinchis’ Rome’s Metamorphosis. The Aeneid is the poem for Augustus’ Imperial Rome’s foundation. Circa 29 BC, Virgil was the best poet in the city and Augustus was victorious after a long war period. Augustus entrusted Virgil to write the poem of his glory. Three books are central in the this epic poem, IV and V, where the narration presents the love between Dido, Queen of Carthage and Aeneas; and book VI, where Aeneas goes to the Avernus to meet his father Anquises’ shadow. mAroma adapts these books and adds a new viewpoint by using Pier Paolo Pasolini’s Mamma Roma. As Mara Negrón points out in the playbill for the staging of this piece in March and April 2006, ‘mAroma navigates through the fragments of these stories without intending a lineal narration of the episodes. The characters circulate in a city without an identity -- it can be any city, any street in the world. Rome is not Rome, but a place of transit, riddled with encounters and misunderstandings, where the characters visit their own desires’ shadows, where the characters turn somersaults (‘hacen maromas’) in-between their past and their present. And at the same time, Rome is always Rome -- a place inhabited by its past. The characters of mAroma are yesterday and are today.’ In giving bodies to these characters, the performers insert themselves in the continuous dialogue between history and present, and the embodiment of that relationship on stage.

=520  \\$aInterview with Patrick Anderson, conducted by Marcial Godoy-Anativia, associate director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. This interview is a part of a series curated by the Hemispheric Institute, articulated around the question 'What is Performance Studies?' The series aims to provide a multifaceted approach to the often difficult task of defining the coordinates of both a field of academic study as well as a lens through which to assess and document cultural practice and embodied behavior.

Anderson graduated from the School of Communication of Northwestern University with a double major in Performance Studies and Anthropology, received a Fulbright Fellowship to conduct research on ritual performance in Sri Lanka, earned an M.A. in Cultural Studies/Communication Studies at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, and a Ph.D. in Performance Studies (with a designated emphasis in women, gender, and sexuality) at the University of California-Berkeley. His background includes training and experience in theater and dance, film, cultural studies, queer and gender studies, ethnic studies, political geography, psychoanalysis, and anthropology. Bridging the fields of performance studies and cultural studies, Anderson's work explores enactments of violence and productions of political subjectivity within institutional domains including the prison, the clinic, the gallery, and the theater. His first book, So Much Wasted (currently in revision), explores hunger striking, anorexia nervosa, and staged fasts as spectacular, radically charged practices that attempt to intervene in ideological state sovereignty. His second book, Violence Performed, a collection of essays co-edited with Jisha Menon, interrogates violence as performance and performative in contemporary global politics. His next project, Against Empathy, argues for a radical re-thinking of how and why empathy underwrites both performance practice and multiculturalist discourse in contemporary American cultural politics.

=520  \\$aInterview with Daphne Brooks, conducted by Diana Taylor, founding director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. This interview is a part of a series curated by the Hemispheric Institute, articulated around the question 'What is Performance Studies?' The series aims to provide a multifaceted approach to the often difficult task of defining the coordinates of both a field of academic study as well as a lens through which to assess and document cultural practice and embodied behavior. The contingent definitions documented in this series are based on the groundbreaking experiences and the scholarly endeavors of renowned figures in contemporary performance studies and practice.

Mónica Cabrera is an Argentinean director, actress and writer whose trajectory has included classical theater, popular theater and childrens theater. As an actress, she works in theater, film, television and advertising. 'El sistema de la víctima' laughs at a problem that afflicts the population: the feeling of being a victim -of not being able to deal with circumstances, or not being able to deal with a secret nature that forces us to complain. This video includes a post-performance discussion with the artist.

La Pocha Nostra (www.pochanostra.com) is an ever-morphing trans-disciplinary arts organization, founded in 1993 by Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Roberto Sifuentes, and Nola Mariano in California. The objective was to formally conceptualize Gómez-Peña's collaborations with other performance artists. It provides a base (and forum) for a loose network of rebel artists from various disciplines, generations and ethnic backgrounds, whose common denominator is the desire to cross and erase dangerous borders between art and politics, practice and theory, artist and spectator.'Mapa/Corpo' is a poetic interactive ritual that explores neo-colonization/de-colonization through acupuncture and the reenactment of the post-9/11 body politic.

=520  \\$aA tale of teachers, artists, and activists, Danny Hoch’s Till the Break of Dawn takes place in the Havana of 2001. Chronicling the meetings and mishaps that happen at a Cuban hip-hop festival, the New Yorkers are confronted by numerous struggling Cubans, an exiled Black Panther, and youth from the global hip-hop scene. It is in this changing landscape where they must confront their changing ideas and commitments to activism, and to each other. Culminating with the events of September 11th, Till the Break of Dawn is a critical look at the cultures of American imperialism, idealism, and hip-hop that affects each of the characters.
=520  \\$aThis work is written and directed by acclaimed actor, poet, and playwright Danny Hoch. A two-time DEF poet, a Senior Fellow at the New School’s Vera List Center for Arts & Politics among numerous other awards and accolades, Hoch is the founder of the Hip Hop Theater Festival.
=520  \\$aHip-Hop Theater Festival is dedicated to presenting and showcasing theater written by and about the Hip-Hop generation. Since 2004, its creators have worked with emerging and established artists to develop work that broadens conversations around Hip-Hop on a global scale. Dedicated to inciting dialogue and social change, HHTF recognizes the power of Hip-Hop and the power of theater as a medium. For a culture whose impact can be seen and felt around the globe, Hip-Hop Theater Festival works to shine light on the diversity and innovation within the world of Hip-Hop.

=520  \\$aInterview with Holly Hughes, conducted by Diana Taylor, founding director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. This interview is a part of a series curated by the Hemispheric Institute, articulated around the question 'What is Performance Studies?' The series aims to provide a multifaceted approach to the often difficult task of defining the coordinates of both a field of academic study as well as a lens through which to assess and document cultural practice and embodied behavior. The contingent definitions documented in this series are based on the groundbreaking experiences and the scholarly endeavors of renowned figures in contemporary performance studies and practice.
=520  \\$aHolly Hughes (1955) is an internationally acclaimed performance artist with a flair for telling outrageous stories of everyday lesbian life, touching off controversy and challenging complacency at every turn. Her combination of poetic imagery and political satire has earned her wide attention and placed her work at the center of America's culture wars. Hughes is Associate Professor of the School of Art & Design and the Department of Theatre and Drama at the University of Michigan and an activist for lesbian issues. She is the recipient of two Village Voice Obie awards, a Lambda Book Award, a GLAAD media award, and a Distinguished Alumni Award. Hughes has performed at venues across North America, Great Britain and Australia. She has published two books: Clit Notes: A Sapphic Sampler; and O Solo Homo: The New Queer Performance, co-edited with Dr. David Roman. In addition, her work has been widely anthologized and has served as foundational material for performance studies, queer studies and feminist performance studies. Hughes is currently co-editing, with Alina Troyano, 'Memories of the Revolution,' an anthology of scripts, interviews and photographs from the first ten years of the New York City’s Wow Café.

=520  \\$aWithin the folds of the zona pellucida, rapt in a somnambulous state, the accused begins to believe she is capable of the crimes with which she has been charged, and that perhaps, somehow, she has indeed carried out the horrific transgressions herself. Zona Pellucida, multimedia theater piece by 2boys.tv, was performed as a part of the 6th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, celebrated in June of 2007 in Buenos Aires, Argentina under the title CORPOLÍTICAS en las Américas: Formaciones de Raza, Clase y Género / Body Politics in the Americas: Formations of Race, Class and Gender. 2boys.tv (Aaron Pollard and Stephen Lawson) is a theater and cabaret duo based in Montréal, Canada. Their multimedia performance pieces often incorporate video projections, soundscapes, found and original music scores, transgendered apparitions, outrageous costume, props, vocal/textual works, and the art of lip-sync. The video includes a post-performance discussion with the artists, moderated by Ramón Rivera-Servera.

The computer is now an irreversible part of how improvisation has become a site for interdisciplinary exploration, exchanges of personal and cultural narratives, and the blurring of boundaries between art forms. For George Lewis, living, working, and performing with creative machines of his own design is closely intertwined with the study of how improvisation produces knowledge and meaning. Part memoir, part history and criticism, the talk intersects with critical histories of new media and American experimentalism, as well as ethnographic and historical work on improvisation. George E. Lewis (music.columbia.edu/faculty/lewis.html) is an improviser-trombonist, composer, and computer/installation artist. He is the Edwin H. Case Professor of American Music at Columbia University. His book, Power Stronger Than Itself: The AACM and American Experimental Music is forthcoming from the University of Chicago Press.

=520  \\$aInterview with Tavia Nyong'o, conducted by Diana Taylor, founding director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. This interview is a part of a series curated by the Hemispheric Institute, articulated around the question 'What is Performance Studies?' The series aims to provide a multifaceted approach to the often difficult task of defining the coordinates of both a field of academic study as well as a lens through which to assess and document cultural practice and embodied behavior. The contingent definitions documented in this series are based on the groundbreaking experiences and the scholarly endeavors of renowned figures in contemporary performance studies and practice.
=520  \\$aTavia Nyong'o is a cultural historian with a focus on racial formation in the United States in the 19th and 20th centuries. He has taught courses on black performance, on cultural hybridity, on the history of the body, and on subcultural performance. He has lectured extensively in the U.S. and abroad, and has published reviews and essays in Social Text, Theatre Journal, GLQ, TDR, and Women and Performance. His forthcoming book, The Amalgamation Waltz: Antebellum Genealogies of the Hybrid Future, investigates how cultural performances of gender and sexuality in the first half of the nineteenth century staged fears and anticipations of a racially hybrid nation to come. Major Interests include performance in the black diaspora, cultural studies, queer and feminist theory, the nineteenth-century, history and memory.

The dreams of reason produce monsters two centuries later, Goyas foresight affirms the nightmares of contemporary reason. In a context characterized by the unequal distribution of wealth and, especially, of risk, the politics of fear make themselves felt on the bodies of citizens. Rooted in the socioanthropology of affect, this lecture examines the centrality of fear/terror/panic and the affect they produce (hatred, rage, sorrow, hope) in/between/on the social body. More than an inventory of traits and attributes of a threatening contemporaneity, it seeks to explore the sociopolitical and cultural impact of these processes in the production of bodies. Rossana Reguillo is a professor and researcher at the Department of Sociocultural Studies at ITESO, Guadalajara, Mexico. She earned her PhD in Social Sciences with a focus on Social Anthropology.

Rodríguez performs a fragment of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruzs 17th century poem, Primero Sueño, which the poet confesses was the only poem she ever wrote for pleasure and for herself. As she strips away the levels of the poem, she also strips away her clothes. Jesusa Rodríguez (www.elhabito.com.mx) is Mexicos leading cabaret and political performance artist, who ran the famous El Hábito in Mexico City with her wife Liliana Felipe. She is the recipient of an Obie Award and the first artist named Senior Fellow of the Hemispheric Institute.

=520  \\$a'El Apagón/The Blackout' is a bilingual theatrical adaptation of the story 'La noche que volvimos a ser gente' by José Luis González, set to the sounds of popular Latin songs from the 1950s and 1960s. Riding the subway uptown towards El Barrio, and eager to witness the birth of his firstborn, a Puerto Rican man and his best friend face the Northeast Blackout of 1965. A paean to the courage, humor, and humanity of migrant experience, the show has been hailed by critics as 'the quintessential Boricua play.' 'El Apagón' has been performed throughout the United States, and in Puerto Rico, Slovakia, and Holland. This video was taped in April 2007 at Pregones Theater on Walton Avenue in The Bronx, in celebration of the show's 15th anniversary; the performance was premiered at Pregones @ St. Ann's in the Spring of 1992. Founded in 1979 and based in The Bronx, New York City, Pregones Theater (http://www.pregones.org) has performed in more than 400 cities and 13 countries. The company enjoys citywide recognition for their lasting contributions to the performing arts field and are recipients of numerous distinctions including current Leading National Ensemble Theatre Designation from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Primary Cultural Institution Designation from the New York State Council on the Arts, the New York State Governor's Arts Award, the Culture & Humanities Award from the Center for Puerto Rican Studies, numerous artist and production awards, as well as invitations to appear at international festivals and events. Over the years Pregones has developed a style that combines theater, music and movement, oral and written traditions, and a signature urban sensibility. The ensemble draws from popular Puerto Rican artistic expressions and literature to create and stage its work. Today, Pregones has grown to be one of the leading Puerto Rican/Latino theater theaters in the United States. From migrations to indigenous mythologies to subway stories, the company's repertoire covers a growing sample of Latino experiences and identities.

=520  \\$a'The Red Rose' narrates the meeting of Puerto Rican activist writer Jesús Colón and undercover FBI agent Mildred Blauvelt, and their subsequent face-off before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in 1959. Blauvelt had gone undercover for seven years in the Brooklyn cell of the Communist Party, where she was simply known as comrade Sylvia. Arriving to New York in the winter of 1917, Colón went on to become the distinguished chronicler of the Puerto Rican migrant experience, and one of its enduring contemporary icons. The aesthetic focus of 'The Red Rose' is on the physicality of a work that eschews realistic conventions without doing away with a central narrative thread. Movement, gesture, and dialogue develop in tandem. It combines literary and popular sources, HUAC transcripts and recordings, Colón's private letters, his published articles and stories, press coverage of the Blauvelt episode, and a treasure trove of songs. The production was premiered on November 14, 2005 at Pregones Theater, The Bronx, New York. The sold-out premiere run in 2005-2006 featured international recording artist Danny Rivera. The production won multiple HOLA and ACE Awards including Outstanding Musical and Direction. The original cast recording CD was independently released in March 2006. The production also had a special run at the newly renovated Teatro de la Universidad in Puerto Rico and at the 2007 NY Latino International Theater Festival. Founded in 1979 and based in The Bronx, New York City, Pregones Theater (http://www.pregones.org) has performed in more than 400 cities and 13 countries. The company enjoys citywide recognition for their lasting contributions to the performing arts field and are recipients of numerous distinctions including current Leading National Ensemble Theatre Designation from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and the Andrew W.

=520  \\$aInterview with Rebecca Schneider, conducted by Diana Taylor, founding director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. This interview is a part of a series curated by the Hemispheric Institute, articulated around the question 'What is Performance Studies?' The series aims to provide a multifaceted approach to the often difficult task of defining the coordinates of both a field of academic study as well as a lens through which to assess and document cultural practice and embodied behavior. The contingent definitions documented in this series are based on the groundbreaking experiences and the scholarly endeavors of renowned figures in contemporary performance studies and practice.
=520  \\$aRebecca Schneider, Chair of the Department of Theatre, Speech, and Dance at Brown University, teaches performance studies, theater studies, and theories of intermedia. She is the author of The Explicit Body in Performance (1997). A second book titled Reenactment: Essays on Performance Remains in Visual Culture is forthcoming with Routledge. She has coedited the anthology Re:Direction: A Theoretical and Practical Guide to 20th-Century Directing. She is a contributing editor to TDR: The Drama Review and coeditor with David Krasner of the book series 'Theatre: Theory/Text/Performance' with University of Michigan Press. Schneider has published essays in several anthologies, including Psychoanalysis and Performance, Acting Out: Feminist Performance, Performance and Cultural Politics, and the essay 'Solo Solo Solo' in After Criticism. As a 'performing theorist,' she has collaborated with artists at such sites as the British Museum in London and the Mobile Academy in Berlin.

=520  \\$aInterview with Kay Turner, conducted by Diana Taylor, founding director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. This interview is a part of a series curated by the Hemispheric Institute, articulated around the question 'What is Performance Studies?' The series aims to provide a multifaceted approach to the often difficult task of defining the coordinates of both a field of academic study as well as a lens through which to assess and document cultural practice and embodied behavior. The contingent definitions documented in this series are based on the groundbreaking experiences and the scholarly endeavors of renowned figures in contemporary performance studies and practice.
=520  \\$aKay Turner holds a PhD in folklore and anthropology from the University of Texas at Austin. Her areas of specialization are women's performed folklore (especially in the arenas of oral narrative, folk religion, and material culture) and feminist and lesbian/gay/queer interpretations of folklore and popular culture. She teaches adjunct in the Performance Studies Department at NYU and is also based at the Brooklyn Arts Council, where Turner works as the folklorist for the Borough of Brooklyn, researching and presenting the diverse folk arts and artists of Brooklyn. In September 2006 she curated Here Was New York: Twin Towers in Memorial Images, and in September 2007, 'September 11th Remembered in Film.' In March 2008, she produced Brooklyn Maqam: Arab Music Festival, a major presentation project on Arab music traditions in Brooklyn, held in venues throughout Brooklyn and Manhattan. Her publications include Beautiful Necessity: The Art and Meaning of Women's Altars; Between Us: A Legacy of Lesbian Love Letters; and Baby Precious Always Shines, an edited selection of love notes between Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas. Currently, she is working on a long essay concerning ephemerality and September 11th and a new book project, Transgressive Tales: Rethinking the Grimms' Fairy Tales from Feminist and Queer Perspectives. She is the co-founder of the lezzie rock band Girls in the Nose, based in Austin, TX from 1985-1996. Her current musical projects include NYC-based SNAGGLETOOTH with NYU medievalist Dr. Carolyn Dinshaw, and MEDUSABULLDOZER, a group she works with in Athens, GA.

Created by Diana Raznovich (http://www.autores.org.ar/dianaraz) and performed by Pía Uribelarrea, El cuerpo efímero explores the ways in which anorexia responds to a paradigm espoused by pharmaceutical multinational corporations, the fashion and beauty industries, and companies that make all kind of diet products. The process of producing brand fashion begins in clandestine factories that hire women at slave wages and ends in catwalks that hire slaves who pay with their death.

Mapa Teatro Laboratorio de Artistas (www.mapateatro.org) is a Colombian group that, by documenting the process of disappearance of a neighborhood, seeks to make visible molecular places where residues of otherness remain, traces of that which has been lost, narrations that reconfigure the neighborhood's memory. 'Testigo de las Ruinas' synthesizes, in a non-chronological or linear way, Mapa Teatro's experience during the process of disappearance of a place, and the appearance of a non-place. Mapa Teatro reiterates its interest in inscribing, to the end, its experience as a 'witness' through an artistic 'gesture.'

The group is part of Staging Human Rights, where they work in prisons in Rio de Janeiro and England. They are also associate artists on the Clod Ensembles performing medicine project. Retro Perspective is a short medley of old Split Britches hits that provides a humorous slant on Peggy Shaw's and Lois Weaver's last thirty years of work and play. In Small House, two explorers lay claim to the same territory. These people have known each other for a long time. They occupy a house that has been divided and subdivided by time and bad habits. They sit on a porch, watch the horizon, and wait for the weather to change. Their only hope is an audience. This video also includes a post-performance discussion with Peggy, Lois, and performance artist Anna Jacobs.

The Argentinean Grupo Etcétera has created the Internacional errorista. In their own words, Errorism was born from an error: In times of censorship, we see ourselves subjected to force our language, to take metaphors to their maximum limit, to say without naming. Not being able to use the words (T)errorism or (T)errorist due to their symbolic weight and the danger that this represents, we escape into wordplay. Thats how Errorism was born: in error.

=520  \\$aA head-on confrontation of issues such as school shootings, child abuse, and more, The Suicide Kings’ In Spite of Everything is a seminal work in both spoken word performance and activist art. Featuring one of the fiercest Bay Area hip-hop collectives, under the direction of GOLDIE award-winning, Bay Area legend Marc Bamuthi Joseph, the story weaves through the days following the tragic event and the lives of both the perpetrators and victims to reveal the underlying issues, both institutional and personal, that lead to bullying and youth violence in schools. Opening with a group of writing workshop leaders at the head of a classroom, the fun is quickly stilled as the scene shifts to a police interrogation of one of the instructors about the biggest school shooting since Columbine. What happens next is as riveting as it is heartbreaking. The artists take the audience on a critical journey through fear-inducing journalism, violent video games, and more to reveal that violence and shootings in school cannot only be blamed on the perpetrator.
=520  \\$aHip-Hop Theater Festival is dedicated to presenting and showcasing theater written by and about the Hip-Hop generation. Since 2004, its creators have worked with emerging and established artists to develop work that broadens conversations around Hip-Hop on a global scale. Dedicated to inciting dialogue and social change, HHTF recognizes the power of Hip-Hop and the power of theater as a medium. For a culture whose impact can be seen and felt around the globe, Hip-Hop Theater Festival works to shine light on the diversity and innovation within the world of Hip-Hop.

=520  \\$a‘The Fury of the Gods’ is an exercise in Pop Blasphemy, and an ecclesiastical experiment in Heathenism. It is a sharp biting satire that skewers the sacred and eviscerated evangelical fundamentalism suggesting that it may be the principal obstacle that stands in the way to intercultural understanding, creating a rhetoric of the state in order to justify segregation and oppression. Written and performed by Susana Cook, ‘The Fury of the Gods’ is a series of ecclesiastical interventions that mocks capitalist individualism with a humoristic self-criticism, playing with the idea that evangelical fundamentalism might have mistaken where ‘heaven’ can be found. Susana Cook uses religious oratory to highlight conservative interpretations of homosexuality and exaggerate them, taking them to their logical extremes. As conservative narrative appropriates religion to fulfill an agenda, Cook's work appropriates religious and political language as a means to unveil the ways that fundamentalist belief have come to influence public policy and unmask the real substance and immorality of these national messages.
=520  \\$aSusana Cook is a New York based Argentine playwright, performer, and director. She has presented her work as an independent artist for over 20 years. Her work has been presented in numerous performance spaces in New York City, including Dixon Place, PS. 122, W.O.W Cafe Theater, Ubu Rep, Theater for the New City, The Puffin Room and The Kitchen.

=520  \\$aArtist Nicolás Dumit Estévez’s stay in Banner, Wyoming in the spring of 2008 yielded the plot for a five-minute video, shot on location in a town of forty inhabitants and a thousand private acres. Employing common images of the West such as cowboys and Indians, the goldrush, saloons, and outlaws, the American West is even presently viewed as a wide expanse ready for the taking. In this playful look at the US mythology of the wild, wild West, the outsider protagonist attempts to get in touch with his inner cowboy. However, the landscape reveals itself as a place out of reach and the 21st century cowboy must come face-to-face with a countryside owned by multi-national energy corporations as the ultimate product of US capitalist ideals of private property: ‘Welcome to Wyoming, Inc.’

=520  \\$aIn 'Esclavitud Moderna' (Modern Slavery), a Hispanic man and a woman, husband and wife, are rushing to get to their job, which is ran by an older white man. The wife is hired to clean offices and household, whereas the husband is hired to clean yards as a gardener. The boss assigns the husband to go out and clean the yard so that he can stay at the office with the wife to stare at her body as she cleans the office, especially the floor. She is exposed to toxic chemicals from cleaning products, not to mention the sexual harassment. Both laborers also have unfair work conditions and late or nonexistent payment. However, when they complain, the boss decides to call La Migra, or immigration, and turn in the husband and wife, given that they are not either legal residents or citizens in this country. When the couple decides to leave without their payment, the boss, as if it is another regular business day, puts a sign up in front of the office that says, 'There is work. No papers and no English necessary. Good pay.' This gesture demonstrates the dehumanization and interchangeability that characterizes immigrant lives in the midst of exploitation situations and laws.

Responding to an often degrading and hostile work environment and an increasingly anti-immigrant climate nationally, the troupe uses theater, music, and dialogue to educate and inform immigrant workers about their legal rights; to empower the community by reflecting their stories in their own voices; to humanize the immigration debate for the broader community; and to build a troupe of theater artists that make insightful, entertaining and smart theater for their audiences. Each year TJSF performs in over 50 locations for more than 3,000 day laborers, public school and college students, and diverse organizations, institutions, and agencies.

One by one they are called by a doctor who informs them of different illness caused by sexually transmitted disease, toxic chemical contamination in blood and other organs, and malnutrition. These diagnoses revealed lack of sexual education, health education on chemicals and toxins, lack of proper equipment from their work, and most importantly, lack of food education – all of them key problems among immigrant and impoverished populations.

=520  \\$a'O amargo santo da purificação - Uma visão alegórica e barroca da vida, paixão e morte do revolucionário Carlos Marighella,' a collective creation for Street Theater, tells the story of a popular hero whom the dominant sectors tried to banish from the national landscape for decades. Scene after scene, the audience witnesses important moments of this trajectory: his origins in Bahia, his youth, his poetry, the dictatorship of the Estado Novo, the resistance, his imprisonment, the democracy, the constitutional assembly, his life in the underground, the Military Dictatorship, the armed resistance, his death in an ambush, and the recovery of this history, striving for a human portrait of Twentieth Century Brazil. It’s a story of courage and boldness, perseverance and tenaciousness in ones convictions, and the coherence of socialist ideals throughout a generous and combative life, end to end. Marighella never abdicated his right to dream of a world free of oppression. He lived, fought, and died for this dream.
=520  \\$aBased in Porto Alegre, The Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz was born in 1978 out of a desire for a radical renovation of the language of theatre. During the several years of their existence, they have created a personal aesthetics founded upon the authorial work of the actor, both on the stage and on the streets. Their venue, the Terreira da Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, works as a community theatre school, offering several free workshops open to the public. Their tribal organization is based on the principle of collective work, both in the creative process and in the maintenance of the space. For Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, theater is an instrument for both revealing and analyzing reality, and it's function is social — to contribute to the collective knowledge and to the improvement of the quality of life of the people. In a world marked by exclusion, marginalization, homogenization, by dehumanizing and barbaric efforts, they see it as their moral imperative to denounce injustice, sold opinions, authoritarianism, mediocrity and the erasing of memory. Ói Nóis sees theatre as an art of resistance, in the service of arts and politics, an art that does not fit the market patterns for ethics and aesthetics. Instead, they see theater as a way of life and as a vehicle for ideas: a theater that does not comment on life, but that takes part in it.

=520  \\$aComadre Araña’s concert was presented as a part of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title 'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas.' This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. In Comadre Araña, the traditional music of Colombia's Pacific region meets jazz, rock, pop and electronic music. Three female voices intermingle with the rhythm of the bombo, marimba, cununo and guasá, along with electronic instruments such as the Indian sitar, the tiple guitar of the Colombian Andes, loops, samplers and all the resources of live electronic music. This edited version of the concert offers a privileged view of the musicians and the way they play their instruments - on stage, Comadre Araña functions as an organic experience where human voices and bodies intertwine with musical instruments. It members include; Juan Sebastián Monsalve (Director and bass player), Juanita Delgado (voice), Verónica Atehortúa (voice), Urpi Barco Quintana (voice), Andrés Felipe Salazas (drums and percussion), Rocío Medina (marimba de chonta and percussion), Edwin Ospina (electric guitar, percussion), Camilo Velásquez (tiple guitar, electronic programming and guitar).

This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. 'In a Personal Capacity' was an experimental work that explored, through the collective efforts of its members, the field of information and communications in our contemporary world. At the same time, the members of the group look inside their own work, in a fragmentary self-reflection process that releases questions about their role as artists, as a collective, and as Colombians. Directed by Santiago García, Teatro La Candelaria was founded in 1966 by a group of independent artists and intellectuals. Engaged in an ongoing exploration of national folklore, events, and characters, much of their repertoire was created using the 'collective creation' method. La Candelaria also fostered the creation of the Corporación Colombiana de Teatro and has developed a number of theoretical works that reflect upon dramatic creation, its methods and languages.

At the same time, the members of the group look inside their own work, in a fragmentary self-reflection process that releases questions about their role as artists, as a collective, and as Colombians. This edited version of their performance offers a closer view to their proposal: La Candelaria is a collective, but a collective formed by individuals, a dynamic that implies a continous negotiation between personal goals and the necessities of the collective. Directed by Santiago García, Teatro La Candelaria was founded in 1966 by a group of independent artists and intellectuals. Engaged in an ongoing exploration of national folklore, events, and characters, much of their repertoire was created using the 'collective creation' method.

Mujeres en la plaza) was presented as a part of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title 'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas.' This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. The street action included 300 women, the majority of whom are victims and survivors of violence. Together with theatre and dance artists, they created a living, active and poetic presence, staging an aesthetics of resistance. This event made visible to Colombia and to the world the disappearances and forced displacements, the systematic assassinations of political leaders in the country, and the youth who are presented as 'false positives.' Those who are missing were remembered by walking through a series of panels, which reflected the void created by their absence. Patricia Ariza is a Colombian playwright, director and actress. Forty years ago she founded 'Teatro La Candelaria' with Santiago García. She is currently the director of 'Corporación La Candelaria' in Bogotá.

=520  \\$a'Sonata for Pussyphone and Voice, opus 140' was presented by México’s Rocío Boliver and Ana Luz Álvarez, as a part of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title 'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas.' This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. 'Sonata for Pussyphone and Voice, opus 140' was a concert in four movements performed by a woman who used a musical instrument called pussyphone, which is played with the vagina. This performance offered a reflection on cultural rights for all audiences. At the same time this performance staged a reflection on the politics of spaces, and the politics of art as institution - the femenine body was situated at the center of the National University of Bogota's Music Conservatory.

In this interview, Tania Bruguera talks about her take on how her particular performance-related work makes a political intervention in the public sphere. This interview complements Bruguera's performance 'Double Album: Two Simultaneous Performances,' showcased in this 10-day event, which brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. Tania Bruguera is a political artist who works primarily in behavior art (arte de conducta). Her work explores the role of the audience in performances and the relationship between ethics and desire. In 2002 she created the Cátedra Arte de Conducta, the first center in Havana dedicated to the study of political art.

=520  \\$aGuillermo Gómez-Peña and Tania Bruguera presented 'Two Simultaneous Performances' as a part of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title 'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas.' This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. Although their projects emerged from different geographical contexts and different performance languages, Bruguera and Gómez-Peña engaged in a 'performatic conversation' whose goal was to 'coexist and co-create a parallel, temporary universe' as 'an act of international reconciliation.' This is a video documentation of Tania Bruguera’s contribution to the conversation, 'Untitled (Bogotá, 2009),' presented as part of the artist's series around political stereotypes of specific countries. In this controversial piece, Bruguera brought together a panel of Colombian people who had been directly affected by their country's national conflict around drugs, to discuss their concerns and share their diverging points of view. Unbeknownst to them, the audience, and the curators of the event, Bruguera had arranged for a tray of cocaine to be circulated throughout the space. As the cocaine was freely offered by a kind of cocaine 'server,' focus quickly shifted from the panel to the audience. Some were confused, some were outraged, others engaged in drug use. All of this complicated the issues addressed by the panel speakers - the Colombian war on drugs and those who suffer its consequences - creating a clash between the victims of the conflict and the very drug that is ostensibly at the center of that conflict.

=520  \\$a'Given Over to Want' (Entrgados al deseo) was presented as a part of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title 'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas.' This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship.As a part of the Encuentro, performance artist Susana Cook coordinated a series of late-night performances that were staged in Mapa Teatro’s theater space – an old house where the ruins of the past coexist with the vitality of live performances. Every night, participants presented short, sometimes impromptu, cabaret-style performances, transforming Mapa Teatro into an open site for artistic experimentation and exchange. One of these performances was 'Given Over to Want', a piece where sculpting the body with tape, shadow-play, and boxed wine all provided material for the exploration between human want, both natural and contrived. The performance dealt with the themes of transformation, desire, and desirability. The precariousness of citizenship crumbles into an image as primordial as it is hungry, both fully human and fully alien. Bustamante is a performance artist born in California. Her work encompasses performance art, installation, video, pop music, and experimental rips in time. She is currently teaching New Media and Live Art at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, New York.

This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. Since 2003, Campuzano has been working on the 'Transvestite Museum' project, an exploration of the realities of transvestism, a staging of its aesthetics, and a confrontation between its forms of knowledge and official discourses. This performance explored a transvestite body that performs in order to persist in the face of a denied discourse: ritual turned into spectacle, a queer body whose performance deconstructs and assembles its topics and differences as strategy. The 'Transvestite Museum' appeared at the National University within a geneology of Peruvian ritual dance, always from the body: the bodies of the Chicas Extraordinarias in relationship with their intra-university address, and the body of Luis Gerardo Rosero, weaving together objects and subjects of shared memory through his choreography.

=520  \\$aThis impromptu spoken word duel between Guillermo Gómez Peña & Susana Cook was presented as part of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title 'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas.' This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. As a part of the Encuentro, performance artist Susana Cook coordinated a series of late-night performances that were staged in Mapa Teatro’s theater space – an old house where the ruins of the past coexist with the vitality of live performances. Every night, participants presented short, sometimes impromptu, cabaret-style performances, transforming Mapa Teatro into an open site for artistic experimentation and exchange. Both Susana Cook and Gómez Peña are well known for their spoken word works; for this reason, this video documentation of their ‘duel’ is a unique opportunity for enjoying their art and their playful dialogue. Staged as a jam session of poetry, both performers explore issues regarding power, complicity, nation, and gender. Their interaction transformed the surface of the table into a ludic field upon which an emerging community of performers and spectators engaged in a convivial meeting. This experience offered compelling questions about how performance is never a finished product, but an ongoing process of creation and transformation.
=520  \\$aGuillermo Gómez-Peña is a performance artist/writer and the director of the transnational arts collective La Pocha Nostra. He was born in Mexico City and came to the US in 1978. Since then he has been exploring cross-cultural issues with the use of performance, multilingual poetry, journalism, video, radio, and installation art. His performance work and eight books have contributed to the debates on cultural diversity, identity, and US-Mexico relations. His art work has been presented at over seven hundred venues across the US, Canada, Latin America, Europe, Russia and Australia. He is a MacArthur Fellow, American Book Award winner, and a Senior Fellow of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. He is a regular contributor to National Public Radio, a writer for newspapers and magazines in the US, Mexico, and Europe, and a contributing editor to The Drama Review (NYU-MIT). Susana Cook is a New York based Argentine playwright, performer, and director. She has presented her work as an independent artist for over 20 years. Her original plays include: The UnPatriotic Act: Homeland Insecurities, The Values Horror Show, 100 Years of Attitude, Dykenstein, Hamletango, and Hot Tamale, among others. The recipient of numerous fellowships and honors, she has presented her work globally in Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Spain, India, Ecuador, and Canada.

This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship.

Every night, participants presented short, sometimes impromptu, cabaret-style performances, transforming Mapa Teatro into an open site for artistic experimentation and exchange. One of these performances was 'La furia de los dioses,' an exercise in pop blasphemy, an ecclesiastical experiment in heathenism. Written and performed by Susana Cook - first in Spanish, then in English - 'La furia de los dioses' was a sharp political satire of biblical proportions that skewered the sacred and eviscerated evangelical fundamentalism suggesting that it may be the principal obstacle that stands in the way to intercultural understanding, creating a rhetoric of the state in order to justify segregation and oppression. All these issues were intertwined with a humoristic self-criticism, playing with the idea that evangelical fundamentalism might have mistaken where ‘heaven’ can be found.

=520  \\$aFOMMA - Fortaleza de la Mujer Maya - is a collective of Mayan women who use theater as a tool for education and community building. Based in San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico, they are performers, playwrights, and teachers who tour their work in their communities and internationally, performing plays that focus on women's and indigenous rights, literacy, cultural survival, ecology, health, and education in the Tzeltal and Tzotzil indigenous languages. 'El Dueño de las Mariposas' (‘Owner of the Butterflies’) tells the story of Chepe, an orphan predestined by his 'wayjel' - the hummingbird - to change the fate of the slaves suffering under the despotic regime of coffee plantation landowner Don Martín Contreras. The play exposes the despicable living and working conditions of the coffee workers, denouncing the violation of their human rights and demanding that the fundamental rights of these individuals be upheld. This piece is the result ofa process of collective creation on the relationship between politics and the body; the resulting performance brings together symbols, characters and circumstances from the rich Mayan imaginary as well as from the everyday life conditions of indigenous peoples in Latin America, in intricate labyrinths of time, love, injustice, and freedom, an urgent call for inalienable human rights.

=520  \\$aIn this introduction to the 30-years celebration of the first public CADA’s ‘acción,’ Diamela Eltit reads a text in which she highlights the political relevance of this collective in relationship with the Chilean dictatorship, and the hegemonic cultural domination against which CADA performed. CADA’s ‘acciones de arte’ functioned as an archive and artwork simultaneously. Their members wanted to make a strategic material from the excerpt; in this sense, their methodology is based on a fragmented reality, and heterogeneity. The well-known intervention ‘NO +’ was the opening to a rebel narrative, and also opened a space for the word from the streets, repressed by terror. In CADA, arts, politics, and poetics converge, and its legacy belongs to the city and the citizens. ‘NO +’ is now an artifact and grammar of the public domain.
=520  \\$aDiamela Eltit is a distinguished Chilean performance artist, novelist and cultural critic. Winner of the Guggenheim Fellowship and numerous other awards and appointments, Eltit was a member of the acclaimed Colectivo de Acciones de Arte (CADA) during the years of the Pinochet dictatorship, and has been an important cultural presence during the years of the post-dictatorship through her participation in journals such as Revista de Crítica Cultural. Both as an artist and a critic, Eltit's work has made important contributions to feminist theory and she has been a regular contributor to Debate Feminista. In 2000, she published ‘Emergencias: Escritos sobre literatura, arte y política,’ a book of essays which brings together some of her literary and cultural criticism.

=520  \\$aHonor Ford-Smith’s Letters from the Dead was presented as a part of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title 'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas.' This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. 'Letters from the Dead' began as a collectively-created image event commemorating the murder of thousands of youth killed in inner city violence in Toronto's Caribbean diaspora. The event comprised a silent funeral procession in the street. Bringing together the messages from the dead and media reports on violence, and the losses of living, the performance traced one woman’s attempt to bury her grandson and convey his demands for justice in the present. Ford-Smith is Assistant Professor in Community and Environmental Arts, at the Faculty of Environmental Studies, York University. She is best known for her work as the founding Artistic Director of the Sistren Theatre Collective in Jamaica. Her publications include 3 Jamaican Plays 1976-1986; Lionheart Gal: Life stories of Jamaican Women (with the Sistren collective); and My Mother’s Last Dance: An anthology of poems.

=520  \\$aThis is a video documentation of Regina José Galindo’s artist talk ‘Experiences,’ presented in the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. Galindo offered a retrospective of her performance art work, from 1999 to the present, speaking about pieces of art that she links with vital experiences: ‘I have experiences with life’s episodes. I don’t know if these are sad or not. They are simply experiences, and these have shaped me. They have been the fountain of my wisdom, the fountain of what I can speak, of that I know.’ Galindo presents her body as a site of conflict and violence; the painful interventions on her own body are metaphors of different modes of class, gender, and political violence. Her experiences are a source of knowledge and memory, transformed into new images and actions - the basis of what she calls ‘art products.’
=520  \\$aRegina José Galindo was born in Guatemala City. Her work has been included in shows in diverse international venues, such as Venice-Istanbul, Museum of Modern Art, Istanbul; Into Me, Out of Me, P.S.1, New York, and Kunst-Werke Berlin; MASH, Miami; Las Fronteras del Género, Zaragoza, Spain; Estrecho Dudoso, Teorética, Costa Rica; MENS mankind, S.M.A.K., Belgium; Courants Alternatifs, PARVIS, Paris and Bordeaux, France; and Eretica, Palermo, Italy. She has been invited to participate in the Moscu Biennal 2007; I Bienal Arquitectura, Arte Paisaje Islas Canarias in 2006; III Biennale of Tirana, Albania in 2005; Venice Biennal in 2001 and 2005; II Biennal in Prague in 2005; and III Biennal in Lima, Peru in 2002. She won the Golden Lion Award for young artists for her participation in the Venice Biennal in 2005. Part of her work speaks about the history of socio-political violence in her native country of Guatemala; she also addresses economic and political contradictions and inequalities widespread in the Global South.

This interview complements Teatro La Candelaria's performance 'A título personal,' showcased in this 10-day event, which brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. Directed by Santiago García, Teatro La Candelaria was founded in 1966 by a group of independent artists and intellectuals. Engaged in an ongoing exploration of national folklore, events, and characters, much of their repertoire was created using the 'collective creation' method. La Candelaria also fostered the creation of the Corporación Colombiana de Teatro and has developed a number of theoretical works that reflect upon dramatic creation, its methods and languages.

=520  \\$a'A Lesson on Hemi Esperanto' was presented as a part of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title 'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas.' This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. As a part of the Encuentro, performance artist Susana Cook coordinated a series of late-night performances that were staged in Mapa Teatro’s theater space – an old house where the ruins of the past coexist with the vitality of live performances. Every night, participants presented short, sometimes impromptu, cabaret-style performances, transforming Mapa Teatro into an open site for artistic experimentation and exchange. One of these performances was 'A Lesson on Hemi Esperanto,' a spoken word work that questions and plays with intercultural 'understanding,' ultimately privileging the bilingual audience members able to navigate the multiple layers of mistranslation and double meanings. This video documentation represents a unique opportunity to better understand the transnational-hemispheric perspective promoted by the ‘Encuentros.’
=520  \\$aGuillermo Gómez-Peña is a performance artist/writer and the director of the transnational arts collective La Pocha Nostra. He was born in Mexico City and came to the US in 1978. Since then he has been exploring cross-cultural issues with the use of performance, multilingual poetry, journalism, video, radio, and installation art. His performance work and eight books have contributed to the debates on cultural diversity, identity, and US-Mexico relations. His art work has been presented at over seven hundred venues across the US, Canada, Latin America, Europe, Russia and Australia. He is a MacArthur Fellow, American Book Award winner, and a Senior Fellow of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. He is a regular contributor to National Public Radio, a writer for newspapers and magazines in the US, Mexico, and Europe, and a contributing editor to The Drama Review (NYU-MIT).

This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. Although their projects emerged from different geographical contexts and different performance languages, Tania Bruguera and Guillermo Gómez-Peña engaged in a 'performatic conversation' whose goal was to 'coexist and co-create a parallel, temporary universe' as 'an act of international reconciliation.' This is a video documentation of Guillermo Gómez Peña’s collaboration for 'Two Simultaneous Performances'. In '10 Psychomagical Actions Against Violence,' Gómez-Peña explored both the legacy of fear of the Other - the criminalization of the brown body inherited by the Bush administration - and the emerging culture of hope, imagination and faith that has developed in response to the former world order. Gómez-Peña is a performance artist/writer and the director of the transnational arts collective La Pocha Nostra. He was born in Mexico City and came to the US in 1978. Since then he has been exploring cross-cultural issues with the use of performance, multilingual poetry, journalism, video, radio, and installation art.

This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. Astrid Hadad's 'Bizarre Cabaret' was a performance mixed with a batucada, in the middle of a theatrical scene with a historical cultural background based on the anthropological sciences of different eras. Hadad's shows consist of fast-paced, fragmented, parodic unveilings of traditional Mexican song, dress, dance, and political satire. She incorporates elements from Mexican visual arts, music, and cinema, along with actions and gestures from popular culture. Astrid Hadad was born in Chetumal, Quintana Roo, Mexico. She graduated from the Centro Universitario de Teatro after deserting her studies in Political and Social Sciences at the Universidad de México. Hadad uses cabaret and performance to represent social, cultural, and political crisis in Mexico and, in turn, to entertain. Since rejecting institutional support and affiliation early in her career, Hadad has written, produced, managed, and promoted her own work, establishing audiences throughout Mexico, the U.S., Europe, Australia, Canada, and Latin America, gaining reknown for her shows, Heavy Nopal, La Multimamada, La Pecadora, Seducida y Abandonada, and Corazon Sangrante. As an accomplished vocalist, her albums circulate internationally.

This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. With an introduction by María Belén Sáez de Ibarra, Andreas Huyssen’s keynote proposes that human rights and memory discourses must be robustly linked with each other to add a necessary dimension of futurity to memory and of history to human rights politics. This keynote asks to what extent ‘rights of nature’ need to be considered to nurture the sustainability of human rights as social rights. Andreas Huyssen is Villard Professor of German and Comparative Literature at Columbia University. He is founding director of Columbia’s Institute for Comparative Literature and Society (1998-2003). His books include After the Great Divide: Modernism, Mass Culture, Postmodernism (1986), and Present Pasts: Urban Palimpsests and the Politics of Memory (2003). He is the editor, most recently, of Other Cities, Other Worlds: Urban Imaginaries in a Globalizing Age (2008).

=520  \\$a'Phobophilia, arousal from fear,' by Stephen Lawson and Aaron Pollard of 2boys.tv, was presented as a part of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title 'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas.' This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. In this performance, a small number of spectators are blindfolded and led to a secret location to witness a peculiar interrogation. 'Phobophilia' poses the question: What is the role of the poet in an age characterized by fear? The performance, inspired by the life and art of Jean Cocteau, explores the relationship between artist and audience, and the negotiations established upon a sensation of fear that can be mesmerizing. This negotation also exists within the artistic practice: the performer's physical body interacts with a video projection of himself - a miniature that is both vulnerable and powerful. 2boys.tv is a transdisciplinary duo from Montreal, Canada composed by Stephen Lawson and Aaron Pollard (also notoriously known in some circles as alter egos Gigi L’Amour and Pipi Douleur). They have created a wide repertoire of epic multimedia cabaret works, performances, videos, and installations.

=520  \\$a'Phobophilia, arousal from fear,' by Stephen Lawson and Aaron Pollard of 2boys.tv, was presented as a part of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title 'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas.' This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. In this performance, a small number of spectators are blindfolded and led to a secret location to witness a peculiar interrogation. 'Phobophilia' poses the question: What is the role of the poet in an age characterized by fear? This edited version offers additional material that follows the audience's walk towards the performance - a path that leads them to the experience of darkness and fear; a path that perhaps never ends. The performance, inspired by the life and art of Jean Cocteau, explores the relationship between artist and audience, and the negotiations established upon a sensation of fear that can be mesmerizing. This negotation also exists within the artistic practice: the performer's physical body interacts with a video projection of himself - a miniature that is both vulnerable and powerful. 2boys.tv is a transdisciplinary duo from Montreal, Canada composed by Stephen Lawson and Aaron Pollard (also notoriously known in some circles as alter egos Gigi L’Amour and Pipi Douleur). They have created a wide repertoire of epic multimedia cabaret works, performances, videos, and installations.

=520  \\$a'Show Business,' by Stephen Lawson and Aaron Pollard of 2boys.tv, was presented as a part of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title 'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas.' This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. As a part of the Encuentro, performance artist Susana Cook coordinated a series of late-night performances that were staged in Mapa Teatro’s theater space – an old house where the ruins of the past coexist with the vitality of live performances. Every night, participants presented short, sometimes impromptu, cabaret-style performances, transforming Mapa Teatro into an open site for artistic experimentation and exchange. One of these performances was 'Show Business,' a lip-synch performance, with which 2boys.tv splice together iconic American popular cultural motifs with images generated by the western world’s first great propaganda machine: The Vatican. This collision of Broadway, Hollywood, and Catholicism reveals both the funny and frightening correlations between the church and show business. 2boys.tv is a transdisciplinary duo from Montreal, Canada composed by Stephen Lawson and Aaron Pollard (also notoriously known in some circles as alter egos Gigi L’Amour and Pipi Douleur). They have created a wide repertoire of epic multimedia cabaret works, performances, videos, and installations.

=520  \\$aMuiraquitã is a lucky amulet, a frog, representing knowledge and fertility in the Amerindian world. It names this project of artistic investigation on the Afro-Amerindian traditions by artist and researcher Zeca Ligiéro. The Muiraquitã project was awarded the Residência Artística 2009 grant by FUNARTE/MINC for the Ponto de Cultura Reconquering Culture, Art and Citizenship of Marajó. The city of Soure is located in the Marajó Island in the State of Pará, on the mouth of the Amazonas River. The video is a documentation of interviews with artists, popular masters, local stories and natural medicines. It also documents performances of typical dances developed by the Grupo de Dança Tradições Marajoara Cruzeirinho, two 'caboclo' rituals, an entity considered of Afro-Amerindian origin typical of the Tambor de Mina - a religion specific to the States of Pará and Maranhão, the Casa de Fulúpa de Cabocla Ita of the Mother of Saint Iya Decy and the Terreiro de Yansã de Nossa Senhora da Conceição de Mãe Fátima. The project was completed in April 2010.

He coordinates since 1998 the Center for the Study of Afro-Amerindian Performances-NEPAA, which is dedicated to promoting research, dissemination, and exchange with various cultures of African, Indigenous, and other non-hegemonic origin, and to studying their inter-relations within Brazil.

=520  \\$aThis play tells the story of the first Brazilian black clown, starting with his childhood during the period of slavery in Brazil, through his running away with the circus. There he trained as a juggler, rope-walker, and acrobat, and became a famous clown. Benjamin brought theater to the circus, and was thus one of the precursors of the Circus-Theater, staging classic works such as José de Alencar and Carlos Gomes' O Guarani, as well as creating his own plays. Zeca Ligiéro's adaptation and staging creates a contemporary performance with a couple of black actors, based on both theater and circus techniques. It also adds to these the storytelling of the ancient African griots, transformed in the New World into storytellers that sometimes brought a story lived by heroes of the past, and sometimes told a fable or ancient myth of the African continent. All of this combined with melodrama, dance, and song.

=520  \\$aDavid Lozano presented 'Marca y Ego, oficios para el cuerpo' as a part of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title 'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas.' This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. Lozano’s work investigates how the body is constructed and conceptualized within institutions of state control. The alternate title for this performance, '12 Physical-Rhythmical Exercises of the Americas, without Weapons,' proposes compelling questions about the construction of the physical and the political body, always fluctuating between the individualistic and the social, and resisting or assimilating institutional conventions. The fact that performance was presented at the entrance of the Universidad Nacional de Bogotá also implies a reflection about the autonomy of this institution in relation to other organisms of control. David Lozano is a visual artist with a specialization in painting. He has a Masters degree in Visual and Fine Arts from the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. He teaches at the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Unviersidad de los Andes, Santo Tomás de Aquino and the Academy of Superior Arts of Bogotá. Currently he is a teacher and the director of the School of Visual Arts at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. As an artist, his work has focused on the investigation of the pós-moderno and globalized body.

This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. The performance was a reflection on genetically-modified corn and its disastrous consequences for life—for the original natural species as well as for the communities that have cultivated corn since ancient times, developing entire cultures around it. Luna is an actress and a performance artist. Violeta Luna obtained her graduate degree in Acting from the Centro Universitario de Teatro in Mexico City. Since 1998 she has been an associate artist of La Pocha Nostra under the direction of Guillermo Gómez-Peña.

=520  \\$a‘Químicos’ (Chemicals) is a story in three parts. The first part recreates how day laborers are hired on the streets to do dangerous work, where they will use toxic chemicals and will not use proper equipment for protection. The second part describes the dangerous conditions in which day laborers work, and the difficulty they have in seeking professional health physicians when they are ill. The third part reflects upon the health of Hispanic/Latino communities, which are prone to different types of illness and diseases because of the types of food they consume - heavily greased, high in sugar and sodium. This type of nutrition leads to high numbers of Hispanic/Latino having diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. The ending of this piece is full of humor but reflexive, and advocates for a proper education and information about these situations to prevent illness and death.
=520  \\$aTeatro Jornalero Sin Fronteras /Day Laborers Theater Without Borders (TJSF) is a Los Angeles-based ensemble theater company comprised of day laborers. Founded in 2008 by Cornerstone Theater Company in conjunction with the National Day Labor Organizing Network, their mission is to improve the lives of day laborers by creating plays by and for the day labor community. Responding to an often degrading and hostile work environment and an increasingly anti-immigrant climate nationally, the troupe uses theater, music, and dialogue to educate and inform immigrant workers about their legal rights; to empower the community by reflecting their stories in their own voices; to humanize the immigration debate for the broader community; and to build a troupe of theater artists that make insightful, entertaining and smart theater for their audiences. Each year TJSF performs in over 50 locations for more than 3,000 day laborers, public school and college students, and diverse organizations, institutions, and agencies.

=520  \\$a‘Demolición’ (Demolition) is a play about a group of day laborers hired to demolish a house that needs various repairs. Since these workers hardly speak any English to understand the address and instructions given to them, they search for someone who can translate. However, due to a miscommunication, they end up demolishing the wrong house. When the owners of the demolished house arrived, there is a succession of events both comic and tragic. Finally, the leader of the group, who made the contract, flees and leaves the rest of the day laborers behind without payment while shouting 'It was horrible, it was horrible comrades. You will get paid on the day of your judgment.' This piece reflects upon the injustices and lack of solidarity that immigrant laborers have to confront.

=520  \\$a‘Caminos al Paraíso’ (Paths to Paradise) is a story in three parts. It narrates all the adrenaline, fear, and insecurities experienced by immigrants when traveling from Mexico to the U.S.A. They are victims of the greed and violence from people who impose undignified and humiliating acts on them. These victimizers are different organized gangs; the ‘coyotes’ who take undocumented emigrants across the U.S.A. border; and the police who make millions off of illegal emigrants. Immigrants lose their dignities as human beings because they are treated like animals and violated by others along the way. Both women and men are abducted, raped, or murdered by criminals to extort their families who live in the United States – and when some immigrants fight for their human rights, they are killed. This piece is a cry for help and solidarity by the Mexicans living in the United States under unfair immigration policies, and a message about the harsh reality implied in the act of crossing borders.

=520  \\$a‘Bailando con La Migra’ (Dancing with Homeland Security) is a tragicomic, educative, and reflexive play about immigrants, whose luck can change from one minute to the next when searching for work, waiting for the bus, or taking their kids to school. Their lives are marked by the threat of being arrested by Homeland Security, the laws that poorly defend the immigrants, and the lack of proper knowledge of how to act in front of an official. An actor who plays the Forum Theater's Joker figure is introduced to interact with the audience as the play unfolds. At the end, there is hope that all undocumented immigrants and the agents of Homeland Security will come together and celebrate a better, united world. This educative play’s message for the audience is to go out and fight for immigration reform for all the 12 million undocumented people who live in the United States.

This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. Introduced by Marcial Godoy-Anativia, Jesús Martín Barbero’s discussion addresses the fundamental issue still pending in Colombia – the very special relationship between politics and violence in the fabric of its memories and history. In Colombia, an increasingly broad and dense imagination/social creativity is revealing itself in the strategies of physical and cultural survival practiced by millions of citizens, as well as in the new visual art created by women and the audiovisual and literary narratives of young people, allowing us to see the political magnitude of their arts. Jesús Martín Barbero is a semiologist, anthropologist and philosopher. He is an expert in communications and media who has produced important theoretical synthesis around concepts of post-modernity in Latin America. He is a member of the Scientific Committee of Infoamerica.

=520  \\$aColombia’s Andrés Murillo presented 'Monosabio' as a part of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title 'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas.' This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. This site-specific project took place at the Santamaría bullring in downtown Bogotá. A bull was drawn on the sand, and then set on fire after nightfall; the silhouette was then erased, but as more attempts were made to erase it, the more visible it became. This performance exposed the vicious circle of the bullfighter assistant, the ‘monosabio,’ which is born and dies in an eternal return. This performance explores the notions of life and death, both contradictory and complementary – the ‘monosabio’ tries to clean the trace of the death, just to set up the stage for more deaths. In doing this action in a space situated in downtown Bogotá, the performance addresses the current violent political situation in Colombia, and questions the problematic and non-natural circle of life and death that this context implies. Andrés Sebastían Murillo Espinosa is an art student at the Universidad Jorge Tadeo Lozano. Since beginning his studies he has developed a rigorous process that involves working with different artistic practices.

This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. With an introduction by Esther Gabara, Mary Louise Pratt’s keynote asks: What will the world look like linguistically a hundred years from now? This lecture discusses some of the processes of linguistic change, including language death, language migration, and the formation of lingua francas and interlanguages. It asks the idea of rights in this context and considers what an ecological approach to language might involve. Mary Louise Pratt is Silver Professor in the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis and the Department of Spanish and Portuguese at New York University, where she teaches Latin American literature and cultural theory. She has published extensively on the subjects of Latin American women's writing; travel literature and imperialism; language and militarization; and modernity and neoliberalism. She has been affiliated with the Hemispheric Institute since 2002.

=520  \\$aDerived from African folklore, Zomo the Rabbit is placed in a 21st century context and re-emerges as a trickster - a traditional African archetype - who carries a boom box and spits rap lyrics. After being dissed by some of the other animals saying he doesn’t have talent, Zomo calls the Sky God from his cell phone and asks to be gifted with power. She assigns him three tasks: to retrieve the dance shoes of Big Fish, the spray paint can from Wild Cow, and the turntable from DJ the Leopard. As Zomo embarks on a grand journey he encounters creatures from all over who ultimately help him complete all three tasks and learn a very important lesson. As the journey unfolds, so does the show’s message about friendship, art, and what the truest source of power really is. Tight lyrics and tongue-in-cheek humor make this show enjoyable for children and adults alike.

=520  \\$a“Artistas de performance” was a roundtable presented as part of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title 'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas' - a 10-day event that brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. This roundtable offered an opportunity for discussion with - and between - selected performance artists who presented work at this Encuentro. These artists reflected upon their own process and production, and commented on the relationship of their work to the larger themes of the Encuentro. Wilson Díaz presented a retrospective of his visual arts work, which reveals recent Colombian struggles with violence and drug trafficking. His images related to natural coca leaves contrast with cocaine, its derivative chemical drug that engenders violence. Rocío Boliver performed an act of ventriloquism to make an artist statement, and to share her ideas about fear, pain, and excess as ways to challenge the establishment. Tania Bruguera explained how her ‘behavior art’ functions locally and internationally, and what contradictions are implied when an artwork is transplanted to a different context. Guillermo Gómez-Peña shared the difficulties he has in explaining his work as a performance artist (an often misunderstood practice), and the role of the body in decolonization mechanisms. One of the central points of the following Q&A discussion was Bruguera’s polemic piece, in which she distributed cocaine among audience members inside the Universidad Nacional de Colombia (without the consent of the Encuentro organizers). Part of the audience regretted the fact that her highly controversial performance replicated the circulation of drug money and violence that Colombia is currently suffering.
=520  \\$aThis round table provided a space for discussion and dialogue about the artist’s ethics and responsibility, and the complexities of the relationship between performance and politics. Wilson Díaz is a founding member (1998) of Helena Productions. He has been a professor in the Visual Arts departments at Universidad del Valle (Cali), Conservatorio de Bellas Artes de Cali, and the Universidad de Cauca (Popayán) a various times between 1996 and 2003. Rocío Boliver, La Congelada de Uva, has been active in the art world for the past ten years. She began her career as a performer in 1992 with a reading of her porno-erotic texts, directing her criticism toward the repression of women. Tania Bruguera is a political artist who works primarily in behavior art (arte de conducta). Her work explores the role of the audience in performances and the relationship between ethics and desire. In 2002 she created the Cátedra Arte de Conducta, the first center in Havana dedicated to the study of political art. Guillermo Gómez-Peña is a performance artist/writer and the director of the transnational arts collective La Pocha Nostra. He was born in Mexico City and came to the U.S. in 1978. Since then he has been exploring cross-cultural issues with the use of performance, multilingual poetry, journalism, video, radio, and installation art.

This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. With an introduction by Fabio López de la Roche (read by Luisa Piedrahita), Silvia Rivera Cuscanqui’s keynote offers a reading of Guamán Poma de Ayala and Melchor María Mercado as theorists of Andean reality in colonial and republican times. Their images constitute a hidden text that reveals aspects not directly addressed in their writings. Building on these reflections, the speaker argues the need to consider non-alphabetic forms of Andean discourse as a path toward understanding colonial and postcolonial experience in the Andes. Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui is a Bolivian sociologist and activist of Aymara descent. In 1983 she joined other indigenous and mestizo intellectuals in founding the Andean Oral History Workshop, an independent group devoted to issues of orality, identity, and popular and indigenous social movements, primarily in the Aymara region.

=520  \\$aInterview with Jesusa Rodríguez, conducted by Diana Taylor, founding director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. In this interview, Jesusa Rodríguez talks about Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz and her poem ‘Primero Sueño’ (‘First Dream’), a baroque work of art that condenses the genius of the 17th-century Mexican nun. She is linked through memory, history, and feminist statements with her contemporary counterpart, Jesusa Rodríguez, who memorized the almost 1,000 verses of the poem as a part of a creative process that allowed her not only to develop a profound interpretation of its contents, but also a fully bodily internalization experience. This intense relationship with the poem helped her to survive in the everyday world, to strengthen her political struggle, and to fight oblivion. For Jesusa Rodríguez, Sor Juana’s poetry is both a-temporal and contemporary, and a source of inspiration and wisdom to keep working on acts of resistance. As a tribute, Jesusa Rodríguez uses theater to transmit the greatest poem of one of the greatest Mexican poets, and to make it visible and accessible to everyone. Diverse stage elements serve as tools to reveal specific parts of the poem, through a ‘striptease,’ or an autopsy that helps to understand the beauty of Sor Juana’s words.
=520  \\$aJesusa Rodríguez is Mexico’s most influential cabaret and political performance artist, and recipient of an Obie Award. Often referred to as a chameleon, Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her work challenges traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass; from Greek tragedy to cabaret; from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera; from revue, sketch and carpa, to performative acts within political projects. She ran the famous El Hábito in Mexico City with her partner, Liliana Felipe, where they staged hundreds of shows over the course of fifteen years. Most recently, she heads up the Resistencia Creativa movement in Mexico, whose key strategy is using ‘massive cabaret’ as a tool for political action.

As the performer strips away the levels of the poem, she also strips away her clothes, bringing together words and body.

In this interview, Suely Rolnik talks about her take on how her particular performance-related work makes a political intervention in the public sphere. This interview complements her keynote 'Furor de arquivo,' presented in this 10-day event, which brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. Rolnik has degrees in Sociology and Philosophy from the Université Paris VIII and a degree in Psychology from the Université Paris VII. Her work is located in a terrain transversalized by philosophy, clinical practice, politics, and aesthetics and takes the form of research, writing, teaching, treatment, and clinical practice strictu senso. She is the author, among other books, of Micropolítica: Cartografías del deseo (in collaboration with Félix Guattari) and she is a researcher with the network Conceptualismos del Sur.

This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. With an introduction by Francisco Montaña, Suely Rolnik’s keynote discusses how over the last two decades, a compulsion to archive has seized a large part of the globalized territory of art. Among the privileged objects of analysis are Latin American artistic proposals developed during the 1960s and 70s. What are the politics of desire driving these initiatives and their modes of presentation? Suely Rolnik has degrees in Sociology and Philosophy from the Université Paris VIII and a degree in Psychology from the Université Paris VII. Her work is located in a terrain transversalized by philosophy, clinical practice, politics, and aesthetics and takes the form of research, writing, teaching, treatment, and clinical practice strictu senso.

=520  \\$a'The Final Rehearsal' by Peru’s Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani, was presented as a part of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title 'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas.' This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. Set in an old theater, which was also once a cinema hall, a group of artists crafted a homage to a legendary diva whose life story parallels the history of twentieth-century Peru. Since 1971, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani has been working at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. 'Yuyachkani' is a Quechua word that means 'I am thinking, I am remembering.' Under this name, the theater group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru.

=520  \\$a'Memory: Presence and Representation' was a work demonstration presented by Peru’s Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani, as a part of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title 'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas.' This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. In this work demonstration, the members of the collective share their processes of creation with an audience that performs as a witness of the group's own history. Througout this performance composition method demonstration, there is an exploration of various stages of this collective's past performances; in doing this, the performers are engendering a new moment in the development of the group's proposals. Past, present, and future converge in the performers's bodies - a corporeality that mirrors the past and possibilites of Peruvian history, and stages a rehearsal of the future. Since 1971, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani has been working at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. 'Yuyachkani' is a Quechua word that means 'I am thinking, I am remembering.'

This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. 'Live from the Edge' was an evening that showcased the ensemble’s special brand of fusion theater in a 'best of' event that tracks the evolution of their poetic language from childhood rhymes and community rituals to poetry and theater, hip-hop and gospel. Redefining what theater is and who it speaks to, 'Live from the Edge' was a unique performance event that turned the poem into a communal act. Universes is a poetic theater ensemble of multi-disciplined writers and performers who fuse poetry, theater, jazz, hip-hop, politics, down home blues and Latin American boleros, to create moving, challenging and entertaining theatrical works.

=511  1\$aMarlène Ramírez-Cancio, moderator ; Peggy Shaw, performer.
=520  \\$aPeggy Shaw performs excerpts from her show 'Must: The Inside Story,' a collaboration with Clod Ensemble, London. Conceived as 'a journey through the shadows of a city, a pound of flesh, a book of love...,' this piece generates a space of shared and communal affects, such as sadness and fear, but also hope. In the pre-show, Peggy Shaw welcomes the people and leads them into the space, setting the scene for a show that is more an act of sharing - a one-woman show that, paradoxically, is communal. Peggy Shaw’s voice, by both speaking and singing, performs as a source of emotions that are invoked to act as a means of healing. She offers a cartography of her body, a body that can become dust at some point, but that is always leaving a trace of memories. Challenging medical language, ‘The Inside Story' is a way to show internal emotions attached to the body, which are intensified with the presence of a sense of loss. An intimate session of Q&A with the artist follows this video documentation of the performance.
=520  \\$aPeggy Shaw (www.splitbritches.com) is an independent performance artist, painter and poet who believes in new images, and rejects old ideas. She challenges established practices in theatre, prisons, gender, relationships and humor. Her work is firmly rooted in a queer feminist perspective, with an unceasing quest for global equality in writing, spoken word and performance.

In this interview, Vicky Holt Takamine and Jamaica Osorio talk about their take on how their particular performance-related work makes a political intervention in the public sphere. Part of the interview incorporates an impromptu spoken word moment by Osorio. This interview complements the performance 'Hula as Resistance,' showcased in this 10-day event, which brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. Takamine is the founder and kumu hula (master teacher) of Pua Ali'i 'Ilima, a school of traditional Hawaiian dance. She graduated through the 'uniki rituals of hula from Maiki Aiu Lake. Vicky received her BA and MA in Dance Ethnology from the University of Hawai'i. Since 1997, she has coordinated demonstrations, rallies, and marches calling for social, economic, and environmental justice for native Hawaiians. Jamaica Heolimeleikalani Osorio is a dancer who relates her work to ‘Îlio‘ulaokalani Coalition, an organization of native Hawaiian cultural practitioners who advocate for the protection of their native rights and cultural and natural resources.

This interview complements his participation in a round table on Urban Interventions, presented in this 10-day event, which brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. Álvaro Villalobos is a Colombian artist living in Mexico. He received his Masters degree in Visual Arts and his PhD in Latin American Studies from UNAM. He graduated from the School of Arts at ASAB in Bogotá. His work consists primarily of performances, photographs, videos and installations that link social and political issues to the work of art.

This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. 'Martian Operetta' was a remake of the Mexican film Blue Demon y las Invasoras.

Committed to experimentation, and less interested in the actor as an 'agent of fiction,' they describe their projects as 'a laboratory for the social imaginary' that offer a space for presenting community issues and human concerns in media and performance projects.

=520  \\$aFOMMA - Fortaleza de la Mujer Maya - is a collective of Mayan women who use theater as a tool for education and community building. Based in San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico, they are performers, playwrights, and teachers who tour their work in their communities and internationally, performing plays that focus on women's and indigenous rights, literacy, cultural survival, ecology, health, and education in the Tzeltal and Tzotzil indigenous languages. ‘Buscando nuevos caminos’ (‘Looking for New Paths’) is a play about about the false promises that impulse indigenous men and women to find new opportunities in the United States. The forced separation due to migration leaves women by themselves, in a society where they have to learn to survive the violence and greed of unscrupulous relatives. When three young women decide to go to the North and cross the border to find their parents, they have to suffer the abuse of the ‘coyote’ and the difficult conditions of the desert. Trying to escape from the dangers in the border, families get separated, as many fractured families due to migration and violence. The women of FOMMA offer strong monologues about the desire of crossing the border – they measure the reasons to leave, but most importantly, the reasons to stay in Chiapas. They end the play with a firm ‘I’m going to live here, and I’m going to die here’ calling their brothers and sisters to come back home and look for new paths in their own land. Q&A with the members of FOMMA follow this performance’s video documentation.

=520  \\$aInterview with Regina José Galindo, conducted by Diana Taylor, founding director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. Regina Galindo talks about the difference of being an artist or an activist during the years of violence in Guatemala -- she reflects upon the risks involved in the artist’s work, finally stating that, in fact, any Guatemalan is at risk in their quotidian lives. According with her clear, rational vision of art, activism is something different and more involved; for her, the role of the artist is to create artwork, which might not have a direct impact in social change, but can promote a new dialogue among citizens. Galindo strongly states that she does not think that she is changing the world; however, the fact that she is not involved in a radical change does not mean that she is not working for a better society. Therefore, she proposes a different form of resistance, through which maybe we are not changing the world, but at least we are not worsening it.

=520  \\$aGuillermo Gómez-Peña’s Border Brujo stopped by NYC to share his spoken word’s enchantments. Always at the center of discussions about US anti-immigration policies, Fulana’s Fabi Fernández opens the show reading the impossible instructions to apply for a visa to the US, while Guillermo Gómez-Peña reminds to whomever it might concern that ‘we are here precisely because you were there.’ Gómez-Peña exposes the contradictions of US anti immigration and anti Spanish language enforcement with his well-known linguistic mix that jumps from Spanish to English, Spanglish, and unknown tongues,. He also generously offers a Spanish lesson for gringo friends who have to work with Latinos (with Barbi and Fabi’s help) addressing the ups and downs of ‘intercultural’ relations. Moreover, in this particular occasion, Gómez-Peña’s persona deals with the coming of years, his fear of loosing his Chicano mojo, and his sexual pathologies with a computer. Between eroticism and imaginary political speeches, 'GGP' shows the power of spoken word, the power of performance art, and how great it feels to imagine.
=520  \\$aGuillermo Gómez-Peña is a performance artist/writer and the director of the transnational arts collective La Pocha Nostra. He was born in Mexico City and came to the US in 1978. Since then he has been exploring cross-cultural issues with the use of performance, multilingual poetry, journalism, video, radio, and installation art. His performance work and eight books have contributed to the debates on cultural diversity, identity, and US-Mexico relations. His artwork has been presented at over seven hundred venues across the US, Canada, Latin America, Europe, Russia and Australia. He is a MacArthur Fellow, American Book Award winner, and a Senior Fellow of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. He is a regular contributor to National Public Radio, a writer for newspapers and magazines in the US, Mexico, and Europe, and a contributing editor to The Drama Review (NYU-MIT).

Using parody and satire, their work delves into topics affecting the Latino communities in the U.S., and responds to the ways products and ideas are marketed and sold to us through the mass media.

=520  \\$aInterview with David Lozano, conducted by Marlène Ramírez-Cancio, Associate Director of Arts & Media at the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. In this interview, David Lozano discusses the role of the body in the intertwining dynamics between arts and politics. Lozano’s performance work explores the relational links between bodies, proposing powerful ways for evidencing and undoing embodied constructions of gender and citizenship. Considering performance as a site for surprise, and for the non-controlled, his work ‘Marca y ego: Oficios para el cuerpo’ offers a reflection upon how bodies are marked as ‘abjected,’ and how those bodies’ textures are a surface that transmits meaning. Although the body is a vulnerable territory, it also can function as a means to subvert preconceptions about the body, within the body, and from the body.
=520  \\$aDavid Lozano is a visual artist with a specialization in painting. He has a Masters degree in Visual and Fine Arts from the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. He teaches at the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Universidad de los Andes, Santo Tomás de Aquino and the Academy of Superior Arts of Bogotá. Currently he is a teacher and the director of the School of Visual Arts at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. As an artist, his work has focused on the investigation of the postmodern and globalized body.

=520  \\$aInterview with Julieta Paredes, conducted by Marcial Godoy-Anativia, Associate Director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. In this interview, Julieta Paredes underlines the centrality of a communal spirit in her work, stating that when she speaks, her voice is a resonance of the voice of her ‘compañeras.’ She questions Western notions of what ‘performance’ is, claiming that the ‘Pachamama’ (Mother Earth) has taught her and her people a cultural performance or ‘performance del pueblo.’ She also points out that the use of the term ‘performance’ might tend to highlight an aesthetic or artistic practice, which can imply a depoliticization of the contents transmitted through actions. Paredes explains how she envisions indigenous people’s communal work, working together from their bodies and sexualities, building what she calls ‘communal feminism.’ Thus, from the particularities of traditional indigenous communities, an active political participation in the public sphere can be set in motion. She also talks about the ‘acciones’ of ‘Mujeres Creando’ and later ‘Mujeres Creando Comunidad,’ which are created to engage with people in public spaces, and to communicate and transmit those social and political struggles that have been invisibilized and silenced.
=520  \\$aJulieta Paredes Carvajal is an Aymara lesbian and communitarian feminist. She was a founding member of ‘Mujeres Creando’ (Women Creating), and she worked with this collective for many years. She is also founder of 'Mujeres creando comunidad' (Women Creating Community), and of the Assembly of Communitarian Feminism. She lives in in La Paz, Bolivia, a place where a hope-inspiring political process is currently taking place. She is a writer, singer and anti-patriarchal poet.

=520  \\$aThis is a video documentation of Julieta Paredes’ talk/performance/no-performance entitled ‘Hilando fino desde el feminismo comunitario,’ presented as part of the CLACS Research Colloquium Series ‘Decolonization in the Andes: Contemporary Debates and Transformations,’ co-organized by the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics and the Department of Performance Studies at NYU. Julieta Paredes stages a transformation during her presentation, changing from her Westernized clothes to her grandmother’s clothes, and so visibly turning into an indigenous woman, or ‘chola.’ Paredes claims that, in Bolivia, ‘nobody looks at me when I’m dressing as a chola: we become invisible.’ Stating also that ‘cholas don’t have a body, don’t have a sexuality, don’t have ideas,’ Paredes’s proposes to engage in political participation with and from her body. She insists in that which she is doing ‘is not a performance,’ but an actual transmission of her sisters and her people’s thoughts and demands through her voice and her body. In this manner, Paredes brings to presence the very topics she is discussing – being that women’s corporeality has been at the center of colonial penetration, she proposes that resistance and contestation against colonialism must come from those feminine bodies. Thus, the task of recovering women’s corporeality and sexuality is at the basis of her proposal of ‘communal feminism’. This is the first step to achieve balance between brothers and sisters, and start working side by side to regain native communities’ sovereignty.

=520  \\$aInterview with Jesusa Rodríguez, conducted by Diana Taylor, founding director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. In this interview, Jesusa Rodríguez talks about the relationship between her experience in theater and cabaret, and her political commitment as an activist. She considers that cabaret provides improvisation as a training tool to exercise negotiation and risk. Also, the immediate response of the audience transforms the artist into a medium that conveys what the public feels and thinks; in this sense, cabaret is a space both to become aware of the current political situation and to foresee what could be upcoming, which engenders a more participative audience. Jesusa Rodríguez and her Resistencia Creativa movement organized a massive ‘plantón’ (sit-in) in Mexico City’s Zócalo (main square) to protest against the controversial results of the Presidential Elections in 2006. She brought together different groups and art expressions from a wide range of Mexican citizens and collaborators, and they presented different spectacles every day during this 40-days sit-in. This demonstration was an example of the art’s role in the struggle for a country’s transformation as well as an act of generosity and solidarity. Based on her ‘artivist’ experiences, Jesusa Rodríguez asks: how art and resistance transform and energize the people little by little every day?
=520  \\$aJesusa Rodríguez is Mexico’s most influential cabaret and political performance artist, and recipient of an Obie Award. Often referred to as a chameleon, Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her work challenges traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass; from Greek tragedy to cabaret; from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera; from revue, sketch and carpa, to performative acts within political projects. She ran the famous El Hábito in Mexico City with her partner, Liliana Felipe, where they staged hundreds of shows over the course of fifteen years. Most recently, she heads up the Resistencia Creativa movement in Mexico, whose key strategy is using ‘massive cabaret’ as a tool for political action.

=520  \\$aInterview with God, conducted by Marcial Godoy-Anativia, associate director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. In this exclusive interview, God’s only incarnation on Earth discusses creation and creativity, sexuality and tongues, lack of reason and politics, priests and children, and even takes a minute to come out of the closet.
=520  \\$aJesusa Rodríguez is Mexico’s most influential cabaret and political performance artist, and recipient of an Obie Award. Often referred to as a chameleon, Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her work challenges traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass; from Greek tragedy to cabaret; from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera; from revue, sketch and carpa, to performative acts within political projects. She ran the famous El Hábito in Mexico City with her partner, Liliana Felipe, where they staged hundreds of shows over the course of fifteen years. Most recently, she heads up the Resistencia Creativa movement in Mexico, whose key strategy is using ‘massive cabaret’ as a tool for political action.

=520  \\$aIn this interview, conducted by Marcial Godoy-Anativia, associate director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, Moysés Zúñiga Santiago talks about his photo exhibit presented in NYC in 2010. His photos portrayed the conflict in Mitzitón, located near to San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas. Zúñiga explains the political and religious confrontation, as well as the presence of the Zapatismo in this zone. He also speaks about the role of the photojournalist, which must aim for social denounce – given the silence of the mainstream media – in spite of the danger that it involves. Finally, he discusses recent events in Mexican history, and he comments how his recent visit to New York City provoked reflections about life in the streets, and the social, linguistic, and racial contrasts that he noticed.
=520  \\$aA native of San Cristobal de Las Casas, Moysés Zuñiga Santiago began his study of science and technology at the University of Xalapa in Veracruz in 1998 where he worked in television, photography and radio. In 2003, he began work in Xalapa at Diario AZ as a photojournalist and was subsequently hired by Milenio de Veracruz as the photography editor. Beginning in January of 2006 he served as the correspondent for Mexican photography agency Cuartoscuro during Subcomandante Marcos’ ‘Other Campaign’ and traveled the entirety of Mexico with Marcos. During this time, Zúñiga also worked with the Associated Press (AP), EFE (Spain), and Agence France Press (AFP). Since 2007, Zúñiga has worked with La Jornada in San Cristóbal de Las Casas and covers the Chiapas region for the Associated Press and EFE. In 2009 he received a Rory Peck Training Fund grant for freelance journalists in high-risk areas from the Rory Peck Trust.

=520  \\$aIn a fusion of song, poetry, lecture and demonstration, acclaimed eco-chef Bryant Terry delves into the origins of ‘Soul Food’. Though often portrayed as an extremely unhealthy cuisine, Terry traces Soul Food back to its plant-based origins and, in so doing, explores the intersections of institutional racism, poverty, and food insecurity. His extensive research into the history of the popular cuisine reveals both little-explored information about what Soul Food is, but also provides an opportunity for reclamation of ethnic cuisine and heritage. As Terry says, this knowledge will hopefully help move African-Americans, specifically, and others away from unhealthy stereotypes and the more indulgent foods which should only be eaten occasionally. As a chef and a food justice activist, Terry is committed to healthy and sustainable foodways as well as preserving cultural food legacies.

Barbi and Fabi share the stage with 158-years-old Doña Cuca, whose longevity has inspired Western medicine to develop the amazing health supplement ‘Hispanacea.’ Doña Cuca opens her shopping trolley, full of US patriotism’s treasures, to have a ‘tea party’... although perhaps a ‘cafecito negro cola’o’ would be tastier for these Latinas.
=520  \\$aFulana is a video and performance collective created in 2000 by four Latinas in New York City (Cristina Ibarra, Marlène Ramírez-Cancio, Lisandra Ramos-Grullón & Andrea Thome). Using parody and satire, their work delves into topics affecting the Latino communities in the U.S., and responds to the ways products and ideas are marketed and sold to us through the mass media.

=520  \\$aThis video recording broadcasts the presentation of archival documentation of ‘Witness of the Ruins’ by the Colombian collective Mapa Teatro as part of ‘Injured Cities: Urban Afterlives Conference,’ hosted by the Center for the Critical Analysis of Social Difference at Columbia University. This conference, convened on the tenth anniversary of the events of September 11, 2001, aimed to explore the effects of catastrophe on cities and their inhabitants, to analyze the politics of shock and terror states use in response to their vulnerability, and to imagine more life-affirming modes of redress and re-invention. Mapa Teatro’s performance/lecture compiles personal and group experiences lived while working on four projects (Prometheus, Run-throughs, The Cleaning of the Stables of Augeas, and Witness to the Ruins) inspired and materialized during the gentrification process of the neighborhood of El Cartucho in Bogota. The many layers of archive and memory are embodied through the voices and bodies of Mapa Teatro’s directors, Rolf and Heidi Abderhalden, who show a ghostly screening of the documentation that remained after each project was created and performed, and remember the impact that they had on the families, the spectators, and themselves. The entire experience was possible because of the bonds established with the inhabitants of the neighborhood as well as the interest in creating a moving memorial monument against ‘the architecture of the emptiness.’
=520  \\$aAfter presenting the fourth project, Rolf and Heidi sit down just to witness the last archive images displaying news about the new spaces that El Cartucho’s people are trying to occupy and the empty park built on the territory where the neighborhood was. In a constant reactivation of the archive, they insert themselves in the process of remembering what they do not want to forget: the living memory of human beings that cannot be erased. Q&A and comments by Diana Taylor and Andreas Huyssen accompany this performance/lecture.
=520  \\$aOne of the foremost artistic companies in Colombia, Mapa Teatro (www.mapateatro.org) has been producing theater, performance and art installation projects since 1984. Founders and directors, Rolf and Heidi Abderhalden have created a wide ranging repertoire of theater, opera, mixed-media performance, and site-specific installation.Their work proposes richly textured visual metaphors in which they consider often complex psychological, social and political relationships. Committed to experimentation, and less interested in the actor as an 'agent of fiction,' they describe their project as 'a laboratory of social imagination,' that offers a space for presenting community issues and human concerns in media and performance. This combination of real-life situations and sites along with highly stylized aesthetic staging produces a tension between real action and (re)presentation. Mapa Teatro draws from live events captured on video such as the demolition of a neighborhood in Bogotá, ritual practice, and texts that explore the relationship of postmodern subjects, myth and metaphor. Mapa Teatro has performed by commissions, festivals and collaborative projects world-wide.

=520  \\$aInterview with Rolf Abderhalden and Heidi Abderhalden, founders and directors of Mapa Teatro, conducted by Diana Taylor, founding director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. This interview is focused on the production, organization, theoretical conceptualization, and the experience of the project ‘Witness to the Ruins,’ created by Mapa Teatro in collaboration with former inhabitants of the neighborhood Santa Inés del Cartucho, Bogotá. The conversation discusses the notion of ‘archive’ propelled by this project, which has become a mobile memory for the city. Mapa Teatro’s work subverts and questions the inflexible coherence that an archive usually imposes to memory. During the gentrification process of Bogotá, El Cartucho’s human side was forgotten under the idea of urban progress; Mapa Teatro’s work intends to recover the memories of the citizens evicted from their neighborhood, emphasizing the role of the body as the space where remembering and forgetting become a present experience. In this way, body and presence remove themselves from the archive, and become the living voice of memory.

=520  \\$aDiamela Eltit is a distinguished Chilean performance artist, novelist and cultural critic. Winner of the Guggenheim Fellowship and numerous other awards and appointments, Eltit was a member of the acclaimed Colectivo de Acciones de Arte (CADA), a Chilean activist group of artists who used performance to challenge Pinochet's dictatorship in Chile. She has been an important cultural presence during the years of the post-dictatorship through her participation in journals such as the Revista de Crítica Cultural. Both as an artist and a critic, Eltit's work constitutes an important contribution to feminist theory and cultural debates. In 2000, she published 'Emergencias: Escritos sobre literatura, arte y política,' a book of essays which brings together some of her literary and cultural criticism. Her narrative work includes 'Lumpérica' (1983), 'Por la patria' (1986), 'El padre mío' (1989), 'El infarto del alma' (with photographer Paz Errázuriz [1994]), 'Mano de obra' (2002), 'Jamás el fuego nunca' (2007), and most recently 'Impuesto a la carne' (2010). Both individually and as a member of CADA, Diamela Eltit was one of the most important contributors to the 'Escena de Avanzada.' Eltit has also held positions as writer-in-residence at Brown University, Washington University in St. Louis, Columbia University, UC/Berkeley the University of Virginia, Stanford University and Johns Hopkins University. She is currently the Distinguished Global Professor of Creative Writing in Spanish at NYU.

=520  \\$aInterview with Rossana Reguillo, conducted by Diana Taylor, founding director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. In this interview, Professor Reguillo speaks about how fear, interplaying with other emotions like anger and hope, is structurally used by different governments to shape politics of passions. She maps recent historical events to analyze how state authorities control fears and hopes of citizens all over the Americas. She also analyzes the conflict between the Mexican government and the ‘narco’ criminal culture as the site where politics of passions strongly emerge. For her, these convulse relationships function as machines that produce uncertainties - the basis for political emotions. Examples such as the events of September 11 illustrate how fear and anger are attributed to certain subjects, who become the ‘monsters’ to be punished. Toward the end of the interview, Professor Reguillo speaks about current civil society movements of resistance, such as Occupy Wall Street, as new expressions of political passions, and the role of young citizens as the main actors for political participation.

=520  \\$aMildred Ruiz and Steven Sapp of Universes give an artist talk about their performance work. The artist talk begins with a live excerpted performance from Ameriville, following with a screening of the group’s trajectory. Since meeting each other at Bard College in upstate New York, Steven Sapp and Mildred Ruiz have always returned to the Bronx to find and to build a run down community. In response to seeing the crime, drug use, and violence in the Bronx, Steven and Mildred created ‘The Point’ community center, where Universes became a theatre group and began a journey of making performance work. The artist talk is followed by a Q&A with audience members.

Song and movement are accompanied by vivid images and video projected on screen, commenting on issues of gentrification, natural disaster, class warfare, racial discrimination, and economic oppression. The piece also critiques the lack of healthcare coverage, religious hierarchy, and the wealthy in the States. Universes activates our political imagination, considering the possibility of artists, poets, and activists taking the places of government officials, where the common everyday person can work as an individual and as a part of a community.

=520  \\$a'Widows, Performance about Absence' is part of the continuing theater research the Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz has been undertaking on the imagery and recent history of Latin America. Using Ariel Dorfman and Tony Kushner’s Widows as a starting point, the Tribe continues its investigation into the ritual scene, within the trajectory of Teatro de Vivência (experiential theater). 'Widows' features women who fight for the right of knowing where are the men who were disappeared or killed by the military dictatorship that the country went through. It is an allegory about the events that took place in the last decades in Latin America, and the need to keep the memory of this time of horror alive, so that it does not repeat itself. Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz’ Teatro de Vivência strives for an open and sincere relationship with the audience, in which actors and spectators share a common experience with the intensity of a unique event, capable of producing new modes of perception.
=520  \\$aBased in Porto Alegre, The Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz was born in 1978 out of a desire for a radical renovation of the language of theatre. During the several years of their existence, they have created a personal aesthetics founded upon the authorial work of the actor, both on the stage and on the streets. Their venue, the Terreira da Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, works as a community theatre school, offering several free workshops open to the public. Their tribal organization is based on the principle of collective work, both in the creative process and in the maintenance of the space. For Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, theater is an instrument for both revealing and analyzing reality, and it's function is social — to contribute to the collective knowledge and to the improvement of the quality of life of the people. In a world marked by exclusion, marginalization, homogenization, by dehumanizing and barbaric efforts, they see it as their moral imperative to denounce injustice, sold opinions, authoritarianism, mediocrity and the erasing of memory. Ói Nóis sees theatre as an art of resistance, in the service of arts and politics, an art that does not fit the market patterns for ethics and aesthetics. Instead, they see theater as a way of life and as a vehicle for ideas: a theater that does not comment on life, but that takes part in it.

=520  \\$aInterview with João Gabriel Teixeira, conducted by Marcos Steuernagel, Special Collections Fellow at the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. This interview is a part of a series curated by the Hemispheric Institute, articulated around the question 'What is Performance Studies?' The series aims to provide a multifaceted approach to the often difficult task of defining the coordinates of both a field of academic study as well as a lens through which to assess and document cultural practice and embodied behavior. The contingent definitions documented in this series are based on the groundbreaking experiences and the scholarly endeavors of renowned figures in contemporary performance studies and practice.
=520  \\$aJoão Gabriel Lima Cruz Teixeira graduated in Social Sciences at Universidade Federal da Bahia (1968); he also holds a Master in Interamerican Studies from the University of Miami (1970), and a Doctorate in Sociology from the University of Sussex (1984). He is currently Associated Professor II at Universidade de Brasília. He finished post-graduate programs at the New School for Social Research, New York (1993-1994), and the Maison des Sciences de l'Homme, Paris Nord (2003-2004). Professor Teixeira works on Sociology of Art, with emphasis in theory and practice of performance. His research interests include performance and identity, culture, art, theater, and education. He has edited, with Letícia Vianna, the book ‘As artes populares no planalto central: performance e identidade’ (2010), and has recently published ‘Brasília 50 anos: arte e cultura’ (2011), where he reflects upon the capital city of Brazil. His work is based not only on the analysis of social indicators, but also on productive conversations with cultural figures born and/or raised in Brasilia, to propose questions about the relationship between society and its artistic representations.

=518  \\$aPerformed at the SP Escola de Teatro, São Paulo, Brazil, on January 16, 2013.
=520  \\$a'Algo en la cocina,' by Arthur Aviles, was presented as a part of the 8th International Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. This Encuentro was held in January of 2013 - the year of Hemi’s 15th anniversary - in São Paulo, Brazil, under the title CITIES | BODIES | ACTION: The Politics of Passion in the Americas. This event brought together activism, scholarship, and art towards the exploration of urban sites as areas of coexistence, conflict, and collaboration. From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. The vast array of performances, exhibits, roundtables, workshops, lectures and work groups of this Encuentro were particularly interested in the ways in which bodies both interpellate and are interpellated, mobilize and are mobilized, by and around the diverse and complex 'passions' that are so defining of our globalized and mediatized present - fear, hatred, disenchantment, hope and faith, among others.
=520  \\$aIn ‘Algo en la cocina,’ Arthur Aviles transits in-between the flux of the masculine and the feminine, and beyond. Dance movements that are delicate, precise, and strong at the same time, touch the flexible matter of which our bodies are made, and demonstrate that gender, sexuality, and eroticism are an invitation to enjoy life.
=520  \\$aArthur Aviles was born in Queens and grew up in Long Island and the Bronx. He received a B/A in Theatre/Dance from BARD college. He was a member of Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company from '87 to '95 and received a New York Dance and performance award (Bessie) in 1989. He founded his dance company Arthur Aviles Typical Theatre in '96. In '98, he along with Charles Rice-Gonzalez inaugurated a new performance space in the South Bronx. BAAD! - The Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance.

=520  \\$aInterview with Laura Levin, conducted Mark Matusoff. This interview is a part of a series curated by the Hemispheric Institute, articulated around the question 'What is Performance Studies?' The series aims to provide a multifaceted approach to the often difficult task of defining the coordinates of both a field of academic study as well as a lens through which to assess and document cultural practice and embodied behavior. The contingent definitions documented in this series are based on the groundbreaking experiences and the scholarly endeavors of renowned figures in contemporary performance studies and practice.
=520  \\$aLaura Levin is a performance theorist whose research focuses on contemporary theatre and performance art, performing gender and sexuality, site-specific and urban performance, and intermediality in performance. She is Editor-in-Chief of Canadian Theatre Review and has edited a number of collections: an issue of Theatre Research in Canada on Space and Subjectivity in Performance; a CTR issue on Performance Art; an issue of Performance Research on Performing Publics, Conversations Across Borders (Seagull Books, 2011); and Theatre and Performance in Toronto (Playwrights Canada Press, 2011). Her current research, which focuses on gender, performance, and space, appears in several edited volumes including Judith Thompson (ed. Ric Knowles) and Space and the Geographies of Canadian Theatre (ed. Michael McKinnie), and Performance and the City (eds. Kim Solga, DJ Hopkins, and Shelley Orr). She has worked as a director and dramaturg on a number of productions in North America and several practice-based research projects that investigate intersections of performance, geography, and digital technologies. In 2008, Laura Levin was awarded a SSHRC Standard Grant for ‘The Canadian Performance Studies Project,’ the first major research study to theorize and map the field of performance studies as it has emerged in Canada. As part of this project, she chaired the annual Performance Studies International conference, which was held in Canada for the first time in June 2010. She is currently a co-investigator for the Canadian Consortium on Performance and Politics in the Americas, a SSHRC-funded partnership between NYU’s Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics and a network of performance researchers from Canadian universities.

=520  \\$a'Un ser dicho, para ser el nombre,' by Gonzalo Rabanal, was presented as a part of the 8th International Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. This Encuentro was held in January of 2013 - the year of Hemi’s 15th anniversary - in São Paulo, Brazil, under the title CITIES | BODIES | ACTION: The Politics of Passion in the Americas. This event brought together activism, scholarship, and art towards the exploration of urban sites as areas of coexistence, conflict, and collaboration. From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. The vast array of performances, exhibits, roundtables, workshops, lectures and work groups of this Encuentro were particularly interested in the ways in which bodies both interpellate and are interpellated, mobilize and are mobilized, by and around the diverse and complex ‘passions’ that are so defining of our globalized and mediatized present - fear, hatred, disenchantment, hope and faith, among others.
=520  \\$aThis work puts word and writing in relationship to each other as a violent act, by a man who never learned to read and write. The story tells of his desire to understand the spoken word. The son writes in the voice of his father and the father does the same, but on the body of the son, simultaneously: ‘The body, the father, and the son, like the stigma of not knowing.’
=520  \\$aGonzalo Rabanal studied Audio Visual Communication at the ARCOS Institute, where he began to develop a way of working that projects from individual to collective, opening up space for an expressive multiplicity. In 1989 he received a grant from the ANDES Foundation and in 2010 another from the Ford Foundation. He is currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Visual Art at the Pontificia Universidad Católica in Chile. http://rabanalgonzalo.blogspot.com/

=520  \\$aAn avant-garde meditation on coercion and consent inspired by Gédé - the Haitian Vodou spirit of life and death - that weaves moments in Haiti’s geopolitical history with responses to Gina Ulysse's retelling of that history.
=520  \\$aGina Ulysse was trained as a cultural anthropologist, and she is also a poet/performer and multi-media artist. She deploys spoken word to both explore and push the blurred border zones between ethnography and performance. Ulysse weaves history, statistics, personal narrative, theory, with Vodou chants to address issues of social (in)justice, intersectional identities, spirituality and the dehumanization of Haitians and other marked bodies. http://www.ginaathenaulysse.com/

=520  \\$aThe scenic documentary Luis Antonio - Gabriela begins in 1953 with the birth of Luis Antonio who spent his childhood, adolescence, and part of his youth in Santos before leaving for Spain. The show was created from testimonies of the actor and director, Nelson Baskerville, to his sister Maria Cristina, his stepmother Doracy, and Serginho, a hairdresser in Santos and friend to Luis Antonio. The story ends in 2006, the year of his death in Bilbao, where he had lived until then as Gabriela.
=520  \\$aCompanhia Mungunzá de Teatro was created in São Paulo in 2006 by from a newly formed group of actors motivated to deepen techniques learned in school in order to develop a detailed study of Brecht’s Epic Theatre as well as other contemporary dramatic languages. They have participated in diverse festivals in Brazil, winning 26 awards in various categories. www.ciamungunza.com.br
